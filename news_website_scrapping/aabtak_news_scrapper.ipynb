      " ISLAMABAD: Amid a challenging law and order situation in the country, over 128 million people will exercise their right to vote on Thursday (today) with over 17,000 candidates running for the national and provincial assembly seats in the 2024 general elections, The News reported Thursday.\n",
      "As per the data shared by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), a total of 17,816 candidates are in the run, including 12,695 for provincial assemblies and 5,121 for National Assembly seats.\n",
      "They include 16,930 males, 882 females and four transgender persons. The political parties have fielded 6,031 candidates, including 5,726 males and 275 females. A record number of 11,785 independents are also in the race, including 11,174 males, 607 females and four transgender persons.\n",
      "According to the ECP, the political parties have fielded 1,873 male and 93 female candidates for 266 general seats of the National Assembly with 3,248 independents, including 3,027 males, 2,019 females and two transgender persons in the fray.\n",
      "Similarly, there are 12,695 candidates for 593 provincial assembly constituencies, including 12,123 males, 570 women and two transgender persons.\n",
      "Women form 46% (59.3 million) and men 54% (69.2 million) of the total registered voters. However, more than 56 million young voters between the age brackets of 18-25 and 26-35 years are being seen as potential factor in shaping the legislatures.\n",
      "The cliffhanger electoral contest will feature 28.74 million voters in the age group of 36 to 45 years.\n",
      "Those on the premises of a polling station would be allowed to exercise their right to vote after the time is over. The voters will elect the National Assembly members who will then by majority vote choose the next prime minister.\n",
      "Likewise, the voters will also elect lawmakers to their respective four provincial assemblies, who will then elect the chief ministers.\n",
      "Over 260 million ballots — half of them green and half white — have already been printed and delivered to the presiding officers by road and air to over 90,000 polling stations under a security cover provided by the police and other law-enforcement agencies.\n",
      "Security plan\n",
      "To ensure the security of voters and polling staff, 648,000 security personnel have been deployed for poll duties, including 137,000 military and 511,000 police personnel. The commission has already issued the election code of conduct.\n",
      "As many as 90,675 polling stations have been established across the country, out of which more than half have been declared as sensitive or most sensitive.\n",
      "The army will serve as the third layer of security in Quick Response Force mode; however, two army personnel each will be deployed outside over 18,000 highly sensitive polling stations. Their entry in the polling stations will depend on the requirement of presiding officers.\n",
      "During the last over five years, for the first time a prime minister had to go home after a no-trust motion. Some prominent politicians, including Imran Khan, Ch Shujaat Hussain, Asfandyar Wali and Shah Mehmood Qureshi, are not contesting owing to different reasons.\n",
      "Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif is back from abroad and is looking for his fourth term as the country’s chief executive.\n",
      "Speculations are rife that in view of the prevailing political and electoral situation, no political party in the Centre may be able to form the government and hence a coalition setup is being predicted after the elections.\n",
      "Besides the youth, independents are expected to mainly decide the shape of legislatures.\n",
      "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also fielded its candidates as independents. Their alignment, which according to rules, has to be made within three days after the publication of returned candidates, will be crucial and major political stakeholders will be trying to lure them for support. Of the total 336 members, 169 members can form a simple majority government.\n",
      "Owing to the death of contesting candidates, election proceedings have already been terminated in four national and provincial assembly constituencies. These are NA-8 Bajaur, PK-22 Bajaur, PK-91 Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and PP-266 Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab.\n",
      "In a related development, the Election Commission has taken notice of continuous running of political advertisements, statements and texts on electronic media and has directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to hold all such channels accountable and ensure adherence to Section 182 of the Elections Act 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media.\n",
      "The commission has reminded Pemra that under Section 182 of the Elections Act, 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media, after 12 midnight on February 6, there is a ban on the election campaign, advertisements and other written material on electronic and print media and strict action should be taken against the channels violating this ban.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Election Commission spokesman has said the commission has suspended an officer of the Information Group Pir Suleman Shah Rashdi for violation of the code of conduct and misconduct by issuing a video message for support of a particular political party’s candidates. However, he added the officer will be able to draw his salary, allowances and other benefits during his suspension.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has announced that the internet service would continue uninterrupted countrywide. In a statement, the Authority said there won’t be an internet shutdown on the Election Day.\n",

      "publish date:  February 8, 2024\n",
      "contents: \n",
      " The 2024 polls will differ significantly from previous ones, with over 128 million voters, comprising more than half of the population, and witnessing an additional 42.3 million individuals added to the electoral roll since the 2013 polls.\n",
      "In the upcoming polls scheduled for February 8, the youth will be a deciding factor, as voters under the age of 35 constitute 44% of the total electorate. Whichever political party can convince this age group stands to win elections easily, because this demographic eats, drinks, and sleeps internet.\n",
      "In 2018, during the last polls, the country had over 44 million social media users, making the use of new media technology more significant in political communication than ever before.\n",
      "While the 2013 polls are considered the country’s first social media elections, the 2024 ones are the biggest ever in terms of technology use, with 87.35 million internet users in January 2023.\n",
      "Moreover, Pakistan is home to 71.70 million social media users, constituting 30% of the total population, bringing about a significant change in political communication.\n",
      "However, this scenario has its pros, but it also comes with its cons. While technology has boosted campaigning, it has also given rise to serious misgivings as this picture also has a darker side, which harbours active dissemination of disinformation and fake news. Given these real-time concerns, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has, for the first time, included digital media in its code of conduct for the 2024 polls.\n",
      "The commission, in its notification, specifically mentions terms like social media influencers, digital media, and verified social media accounts, indicating its readiness for this new challenge.\n",
      "“During the election campaign, the content floated on print, electronic and digital media, shall not reflect any opinion prejudicial to the ideology, sovereignty, dignity or security of Pakistan, public order or the integrity and independence of the judiciary of Pakistan and other national institutions,” the ECP state in its notification.\n",
      "Despite the challenges of the new information system, political parties have adapted to new methods, from constituency-wise WhatsApp channels to TikTok jalsas (public meetings), in efforts to woo the younger generation. This has compelled government authorities to come up with new policies and monitoring tools.\n",
      "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party of former prime minister Imran Khan, has been highly innovative in the use of advanced technologies, changing the way campaigning is done in Pakistan.\n",
      "With the use of artificial intelligence, the launching of a dedicated portal for candidates, and the introduction of a Facebook bot, the PTI has been leading the charge. However, the credit for these creativities could easily be given to a myriad of gags imposed on the party by the state.\n",
      "In this regard, the Election Commission has updated its policies, incorporating several new topics to cover different aspects of social media. However, some aspects lack clarity, leaving room for manipulation. For instance, the ECP didn’t explain how it would determine “official accounts” on social media, as it is now convenient for anyone to get an account verified on X by making a payment.\n",
      "Moreover, there’s a need for clarity on social media spending by political parties and candidates, as well as virtual canvassing and campaigning, as per Sections 177 and 182 of the Elections Act, 2017.\n",
      "Experts have urged the commission to enforce these policies rigorously, as other government bodies are tasked to assist in carrying out its functions. State institutions, such as the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Press Information Department (PID) Cyber Wing, and Digital Media Wing of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB), are responsible for monitoring coverage.\n",
      "Sharing her concerns, AbbTakk Factcheck Editor Benazir Shah said: “I don’t think that the ECP is going to be able to or has the required facilities and the resources to monitor social media”.\n",
      "Considering the ever-expanding social media landscape riddled with various fast-mutating platforms, Shah pointed out a disruptive change. She said the brands were increasingly flocking to TikTok for their campaigns, making the most of its extensive outreach. She added that as the AI-generated visuals were all the rage these days, social media marketing had never been better.\n",
      "“I don’t think the ECP has the resources. The last time that I got an estimate from ECP they said they had around 4,000 to 5,000 employees. And not only that, you need a dedicated wing of people who specialise in monitoring social media and who know how to keep a track of it and also be able to do it around the clock.”\n",
      "Shah highlighted that she hadn’t read anywhere that the ECP had set up any kind of a wing that is dedicated to monitoring the digital media and the election campaigns on it.\n",
      "“So, until and unless that happens, I think this is just a mere formality that they’re fulfilling.”\n",
      "Echoing the concerns, Digital Rights Foundation chief Nighat Dad, in an opinion piece for The News, wrote that while the ECP has laid down a framework for campaign expenditures it doesn’t clearly mention whether it applies strictly to physical campaigning. Hence, it can be argued that the broader application of law can cover both offline and online campaign financing.\n",
      "“Thousands of political ads run on social media during the days leading up to elections in Pakistan, especially on Facebook and YouTube. The regulation of online and social media campaign financing is a relatively new and evolving area, and, unfortunately, the ECP’s policies are silent on accountability around digital political ads,” she stated.\n",
      "Dad shared that countries like the US have developed measures in this regard and are enforced strictly, adding platforms have their own policies which include background checks and transparency requirements.\n",
      "“A pressing question is: how much can candidates and their supporters spend on online political campaigns in Pakistan? The lack of explicit regulations by the ECP on online political advertising leaves a significant area of campaign financing unregulated. This gap allows for the potential misuse of online platforms for electioneering without adequate oversight or accountability,” she further added.\n",

      " ISTANBUL: President Tayyip Erdogan addressed hundreds of thousands of supporters at one of the largest pro-Palestinian rallies since the Israel-Hamas war began, courting his political base a day ahead of the centenary of Turkey’s secular republic.\n",
      "“Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it,” Erdogan told the crowd in Istanbul, who waved Palestinian flags.\n",
      "“We will tell the whole world that Israel is a war criminal. We are making preparations for this. We will declare Israel a war criminal,” he said.\n",
      "In an hour-long speech, Erdogan also repeated his assertion that Hamas was not a terrorist organisation, describing Israel as an occupier.\n",
      "Turkey has condemned Israeli civilian deaths caused by Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,400, but Erdogan this week called the group Palestinian “freedom fighters”.\n",
      "He also criticised some Western nations’ unconditional support for Israel, drawing sharp rebukes from Italy and Israel.\n",
      "Unlike many NATO allies, the European Union, and some Gulf states, Turkey does not consider Hamas a “terrorist” organisation. It has long hosted its members, supports a two-state solution, and has offered to play a role in negotiating the release of hostages abducted by Hamas during the October 7 assault.\n",
      "Political analysts said Erdogan was keen to reinforce his criticism of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip and to overshadow Sunday’s celebrations marking Turkey’s secular roots.\n",
      "Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and director of the Centre for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, an Istanbul-based think-tank, said Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis and pressure from political allies had prompted Erdogan to sharpen his rhetoric.\n",
      "Turkey “will protect its principles and share these with the international community, but it needs to do this with a more delicate diplomacy if it expects to play such a diplomatic role,” Ulgen said.\n",
      "The heads of allied nationalist and religious parties — which helped Erdogan secure victory in tight May elections — attended the rally at Istanbul’s old airport. Erdogan criticised opposition parties for not calling Netanyahu a “terrorist” and for using the same term with reference to Hamas.\n",
      "Ataturk legacyErdogan had invited all Turks to attend the rally where he said “only our flag and the Palestine flag will wave”. His AK Party had predicted more than a million people would come.\n",
      "Modern Turkey’s 100th anniversary comes on Sunday when newspaper headlines could be dominated by news of the Saturday rally rather than celebrations of the republic’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, analysts say.\n",
      "Erdogan, Turkey’s longest-serving leader, and his AK Party have eroded support for the Western-facing ideals of Ataturk. In recent years, Erdogan’s portraits have appeared alongside those of Ataturk on government buildings and schools.\n",
      "“The symbolism is clear and no one in Turkey is unaware of it — that the pro-Palestinian rally is likely to overshadow celebrations for the centennial of the secular republic,” said Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.\n",
      "She said that while Erdogan’s comments about Hamas reflected Ankara’s long-held position, he aimed to benefit from anti-Israel sentiment domestically and “consolidate Turkey’s Sunni conservatives”.\n",

      " ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Thursday dismissed the impression that the decision of Pakistan Muslim League leader Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan was part of any deal with the interim government. “The caretaker government has ‘no soft corner’ for PML-N or any other political party…How can a caretaker government strike such a deal,” he said in an interview with digital media platform, WE (World Echo) News.\n",
      "The prime minister was responding to a question relating to the PML-N chief’s homecoming who flew from London to Saudi Arabia yesterday with his announcement to land in Pakistan on October 21. Kakar pointed out that Nawaz Sharif left the country as per the court decision “under the nose of Imran Khan’s government, and not the caretaker setup”. However, he said that if Nawaz Sharif returns and takes part in politics, he will have to face some legal obstacles. “The answers to these legal questions lie in legal remedies,” he said.\n",
      "Kakar said any leader be it Imran Khan, Asif Ali Zardari, or Nawaz Sharif, everyone would have to seek their legal remedy as per their case scenario.\n",
      "He said Pakistan was facing the formation of “regimental camps” and the country had been turned into a fighting ground for political positions. He rejected the notion that the caretaker setup could be likened to the 90s ‘Kakar formula’ where both Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan were forced to quit on the proposal of then army chief General Waheed Kakar to make way for fresh election. “This comparison is apples and oranges. It is out of context because in our case, the stint of the normal parliament led to its retirement and we are part of the constitutional continuation where leaders of the House and the Opposition agreed upon my name,” he said.\n",
      "There has been no interference from any institution in our case, he said.\n",
      "On general polls, he said necessary security and administrative arrangements were in place. He said the caretaker government in collaboration with the Election Commission was in the process of the finalization of the required measures.\n",
      "Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar has ruled out the possibility of any delay in general elections.\n",
      "In an interview with a private television channel, he said the polls would be announced and conducted on time and there is no possibility of delay in the elections.\n",
      "Reiterating the caretaker government’s resolve to hold free and fair elections, the Prime Minister said all registered political parties have legal and constitutional rights to canvass, mobilize people and attract public support.\n",
      "On the expulsion of Afghan refugees, the prime minister said the action was being taken only against unregistered foreign nationals and over one million illegal aliens. The government’s objective, he said, was to regulate the movement of unregistered foreign nationals through proper process.\n",

      " ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court directed on Tuesday the concerned political parties to hold a consultation on deciding a date for the elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and inform the court by 4pm today.\n",
      "The directive was passed during the hearing of a suo motu notice taken by the apex court on an apparent delay in elections in the two provinces after the assemblies dissolution, in order to ascertain who had the authority to decide the polls date.\n",
      "The SC directed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leaders Shireen Mazari and Fawad Chaudhry to consult with party chairman, Imran Khan, and coalition partners’ lawyers to consult with their leaders and update the court by 4pm.\n",
      "The directive came after the three ruling parties withdrew the plea they had filed for the formation of a full court to hear the suo motu taken up by the Supreme Court on the Punjab and Khyber Pakhutnkhwa elections.\n",
      "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) had jointly filed a plea via Usman Awan, Farooq H Naek, and Kamran Murtaza, respectively, two days after the SC took suo motu notice.\n",

      "He also raised an objection on the Supreme Court Bar Association President Abid Zuberi, saying that his name had been removed from the judicial order.\n",
      "At this, CJP Bandial said that the court sees the SCBA as an institution.\n",
      "“What is written in the court is not part of a judicial order. It becomes an order when the judges sign it,” he remarked.\n",
      "After this, Zuberi started his arguments.\n",
      "“Supreme Court has declared it in the past that the elections should be held in 90 days,” Zuberi stated.\n",
      "At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the presidents and governors were bound to follow the Cabinet’s advice as per the Constitution.\n",
      "“Can the president or governors give the election date on their own,” he inquired.\n",
      "Meanwhile, CJP Bandial remarked that the governor wasn’t constitutionally bound to follow anyone’s advice regarding the appointment of a caretaker government or deciding the election date.\n",
      "While, Justice Mazhar added that “no one’s advice is needed where there is discretion.”\n",
      "Moving on, the CJP asked that who would issue the notification for the assembly dissolution.\n",
      "Responding to the question, Zuberi said that the notification for the dissolution of Punjab Assembly had been issued by the law secretary.\n",
      "At this point, Justice Akhtar remarked that the 90-day period starts right after the assembly has been dissolved.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired if the caretaker chief minister could advise the governor on the election date.\n",
      "To this, Zuberi said that the caretaker setup and the election date is announced simultaneously.\n",
      "Justice Shah asked whether the governor could reject the caretaker government’s advice?\n",
      "At this, Zuberi replied that the caretaker setup’s job was to look after government affairs instead of giving a date for the polls, which is the governor’s prerogative.\n",
      "While referring to the Saifullah case, Zuberi said that the 12-member bench in that case had declared the election process a must.\n",
      "At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that Article 48 of the Constitution states that every act and step taken by the president would be on the government’s advice.\n",
      "CJP Bandial seconded Justice Mandokhail’s remark, saying that the deciding a date for the polls would be based on the advice under Article 48.\n",
      "While, Justice Akhtar remarked that the caretaker setup is appointed after seven days of the assembly’s dissolution.\n",
      "“Harmony among different clauses of the Constitution is necessary,” he added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Mazhar remarked that in Punjab’s case, the ministry of law had issued the notification, not the governor.\n",
      "Justice Mandokhail said that the government can still tell the governor to conduct elections, as per the Constitution.\n",
      "Justice Shah wondered how could the governor refuse to conduct elections if he receives the government’s advice regarding the poll date.\n",
      "Moving on, Zuberi stated that the caretaker setup was established in Punjab on January 22.\n",
      "“A basic question is that the governor is saying that he didn’t dissolve the assembly,” Justice Mazhar remarked.\n",
      "Zuberi shared that as per Article 105(3) mentions the process of giving an election date.\n",
      "Justice Mandokhail said that the government is not bound to give a date for polls.\n",
      "Zuberi then complained that the date for the polls was not been announced even after so many days.\n",
      "To this, CJP Bandial asked Zuberi if he was arguing that the government wasn’t fulfilling its constitutional duty.\n",
      "“Holding elections within 90 days is the spirit of Constitution,” he observed, adding that the court would ask the AGP to assist it on the legal points.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Zuberi contended that the president would announce a date for the polls if the duration of the assembly ends.\n",
      "“I contend that fixing the date of polls is the prerogative of the president,” he added.\n",
      "At this, Justice Mazhar remarked that a 52-day margin would be kept whenever the governor gives the date.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Mandokhail remarked: “President’s powers have not been stated directly by the Constitution.”\n",
      "“The action will be taken as per the law if the Constitution doesn’t have the powers,” he said, adding that the laws are based on the Constitution.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired under which law the president was “writing the letters”.\n",
      "At this, Zuberi said that the president had written the letters for consultations.\n",
      "To this, the judge replied that the Constitution does not state anywhere about holding consultations.\n",
      "“If we assume that the law allows the president, even then he is bound to [follow] the advice,” Justice Mandokhail remarked.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the caretaker government can also ask for deciding a date.\n",
      "At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would decide if the president needed consultation or not, after hearing the other parties in the case.\n",
      "Zuberi argued that the governor wasn’t bound to follow the advice for announcing the date of election. The same authority as the governor has been given to the president, he added.\n",
      "“The president either is not bound to [follow] the advice,” Zuberi said while wrapping up his arguments.\n",
      "Justice Shah remarked that the governor was bound to follow if he was advised to decide an election date.\n",
      "Elections should be held in 90 days: AGPAfter this, the AGP Shehzad Ata Elahi started his arguments.\n",
      "“The president can give a date for the election only in case of the dissolution of National Assembly,” he said. He added that the other scenario on which the president can give date for elections is when polls are being conducted countrywide.\n",
      "At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the president’s powers to make a decision at discretion and on advice had a difference.\n",
      "AGP Elahi then argued that that the ECP wouldn’t follow the orders if the governor tells it to hold the election a day after the assembly’s dissolution.\n",
      "At this, Justice Akhtar remarked that the governor had to keep the Election Act in view as well.\n",
      "The AGP remarked that the elections should be held in 90 days and the duration shouldn’t be prolonged.\n",
      "Justice Shah asked if the ECP could delay the election if the date is announced by the governor.\n",
      "At this, the AGP replied that the electoral body can ask for holding elections in 89 days if the governor orders conducting election on the 85th day after the dissolution of assembly.\n",
      "On this, CJP Bandial remarked that it was the reason that the governor has been bound to hold consultation with the ECP.\n",
      "“Whether it is the president or the governor, everyone is bound by the Constitution and law,” he said\n",
      "To this, Justice Mazhar suggested holding consultation between the governor and ECP and give a date tomorrow.\n",
      "At this point, the court adjourned the hearing for half an hour.When the hearing reconvened, the AGP continued his arguments and said that the Constitution cannot be interpreted through the parliamentary legislation.\n",
      "“The Constitution is supreme and it doesn’t allow the president to announce a date of election,” he added.\n",
      "He said that the Lahore High Court had clearly said that conducting the elections and announcing a date for it was ECP’s authority.\n",
      "He further stated that the elections was a “subject” for the Centre.\n",
      "At this, Justice Akhtar said that the ECP has to decide a date for the election and the governor has to announce it.\n",
      "Justice Mandokhail interjected and wondered if everything was clear then what was the fight about?\n",
      "Meanwhile, CJP Bandial observed that the hearing of intra-court appeals in the LHC was being adjourned for 14 days. He asked why was such an important constitutional issue was being deferred for long periods.\n",
      "Moreover, the CJP also inquired under which clause of the Constitution, the ECP has been given the power to decide the poll date.\n",
      "On this, Justice Mazhar said that the ECP’s authority starts after the announcement of election date, as per the Constitution.\n",
      "The CJP then remarked that the president had some democratic and some non-democratic powers over the date.\n",
      "At this, Justice Mazhar asked why don’t they abolish Section 57 if the president is not authorised to give the election date. He asked if anyone had challenged Section 57 for being contradictory to the Constitution.\n",
      "The judge also asked for the AGP’s opinion that who had the authority to give the date.\n",
      "ECP has authority to give election date: AGPResponding to the query, AGP Elahi said that the ECP had the authority to give date for the election.\n",
      "In response to AGP’s comment, Justice Mandokhail said that no consultation was needed if the ECP had to announce the date.\n",
      "However, Justice Akhtar asked that where would the governor and president’s role go if that was the case.\n",
      "“Is the president’s role of a news caster that he makes the announcement,” he said, adding that the ECP should use its website if it was just about making an announcement.\n",
      "At this, the CJP remarked that ECP’s role is important under any circumstances.\n",
      "“According to you president’s role is central while the other side says it is consultative,” CJP Bandial said while addressing Justice Akhtar.\n",
      "On this, Justice Akhtar asked if the duration for the election campaign could be shortened.\n",
      "Responding to the question, ECP’s lawyer maintained that printing process of the ballot papers required time. He, however, said that the duration of election campaign can be shortened up to two weeks.\n",
      "Justice Akhtar remarked that implementing the constitution was more important.\n",
      "On this point, AGP Elahi contended that wouldn’t the 1988’s election become controversial if elections have to be conducted in 90 days.\n",
      "He said that the 2008 polls were also held after the designated period.\n",
      "At this, CJP reminded the AGP that in 2008 there was a big tragedy. The CJP was referring to the murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.\n",
      "At this, Justice Mandokhail reiterated the question of who will give the date.\n",
      "“Had the matter of fixing a date been clarified in the law, we wouldn’t be standing at this point today,” he remarked.\n",
      "At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would apply Article 254 where it is valid.\n",
      "Justice Mazhar added that ECP had recommended a date to the governor.\n",
      "On the other hand, Justice Mandokhail inquired whether the caretaker cabinet can send a summary to the governor.\n",
      "At this, the AGP replied in negation.\n",
      "While Justice Mazhar asked how long should the president wait if the prime minister does not send him the advice.\n",
      "On this point Justice Mandokhail remarked that the Parliament could have made a law and given responsibility to someone.\n",
      "The AGP told the court that if laws are passed today then the Parliament is mocked that it is incomplete. He also reiterated that the ECP should give the date of polls as the 90 days period close to completion.\n",
      "“If the dictation on the election date has to come from somewhere else then the ECP can refuse to fulfill other responsibilities as well,” he said while completing his arguments.\n",
      "The AGP completed his arguments on this point and the ECP’s lawyer started presenting the electoral body’s point of view.\n",
      "The SC had taken the suo motu notice of an apparent delay in the elections of the two assemblies, on February 23, following President Arif Alvi’s announcement of date of polls, a move that drew strong criticism from the government\n",
      "As per the CJP, the suo motu notice had been taken to assess who was eligible to issue the date for polls and who had the constitutional responsibility of conducting elections and when.\n",
      "A nine-member bench was constituted to hear the case but the bench was reconstituted after four judges of the bench recused themselves.\n",

      "Former MQM lawmaker and Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Syed Ali Raza Abidi’s affiliation with MQM goes back to the 1988, when he was a student of SM Commerce College. When the army operation against the party started, Abidi – who had seen several tortured bodies of his colleagues – distanced himself from politics.\n",
      "Although he went to the United States for his undergraduate degree in science and business management from Boston University, he had once said that he was in touch with what was going on back home. “It was disturbing at time and I felt helpless.”\n",
      "After coming back in 1998, he chose to be an entrepreneur – he was part of distributing Walls ice cream, and later joined the seafood processing business Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) run by the family.Abidi’s father, Syed Ikhlaq Hussain Abidi, was also actively involved with the MQM and was an MNA from NA-250.\n",
      "Abidi jumped back into active politics in 2008, and formed the Professionals Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) for MQM.\n",
      "His career in politics began in 2013 when he was given the ticket by MQM to contest elections. Being his first time in elections he was able to win and got himself a seat in the national assembly.\n",
      "However, there was some controversy surrounding his seat as a MNA as he allegedly resigned from his position recently when he joined Pak Sarzameen Party and thus left MQM.\n",
      "He was member of the National Assembly, from June 2013 to May 2018.He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) from Constituency NA-251 (Karachi-XIII) in Pakistani general election, 2013. He received 81,603 votes and defeated Raja Azhar Khan, a candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\n",
      "The former MQM leader was a well-educated politician and did his immediate schooling from Karachi St. Patrick School. He got his B.com degree from DHA Degree College and I.com degree from S.M Commerce College. Then he went to states to complete his marketing degree from Boston University.\n",

      "“That newspaper is done,” Bolsonaro said in a tense TV Globo interview. “As far as I’m concerned with government advertising — press that acts like that, lying shamelessly, won’t have any support from the federal government.”\n",
      "Several seasoned journalists working for Brazil’s biggest news organizations told Reuters in recent weeks they have started to throttle back their criticism, fearing a backlash from the Bolsonaro government — and violence from his supporters.\n",
      "Brazilian press watchdogs said there has been an escalation of threats and aggression against reporters. Investigative journalism group Abraji began tracking the incidents in Brazil’s most polarized election since the return to democratic government in 1985 after two decades of military dictatorship.\n",
      "Most of the attacks on journalists were by Bolsonaro supporters, according to Abraji, which recorded more than 150 cases of campaign reporters coming under threat. Roughly half involved physical violence and the rest were online hate campaigns.“Treating the press as an antagonist is not a new tactic, but the aggressive tone and frequency of Bolsonaro’s attacks are very worrying,” said the group’s coordinator, Marina Atoji.\n",
      "Bolsonaro’s supporters said the Brazilian media has a leftist bias and they have turned to social media for news about him.\n",
      "“The worst thing was they tried to crucify Bolsonaro for his controversial statements on women, gays and blacks,” said Emilio Kerber, an Air Force major who ran for Congress in Bolsonaro’s small coalition. “But Bolsonaro has millions of followers on social media and he won anyway.”\n",
      "Press aides for Bolsonaro did not respond to a request for comment. The president-elect has disavowed any supporters who resort to violence. He said he respects freedom of the press and only asks that it be exercised responsibly.\n",

      "“People have been crying and dying but are not getting injustice,” he added.The top judge added, “Supreme Court’s bench number 1 has wrapped up 7,000 cases but when we ask judges they say only 20 cases have been wrapped up.Further, Justice Nisar warned, “Those judges, who issue verdicts on very few cases, will also be tried under Article 209.”Earlier on October 11, President Arif Alvi removed Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as a judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), a notification issued by the law ministry said on Thursday.\n",
      "The president took the decision after the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommended his removal, the statement added.A letter written by the SJC had emerged earlier in the day, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July earlier this year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.\n",
      "“The council is unanimously of the opinion that in the matter of making his speech before the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi on [July 21] Mr. Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui […] had displayed conduct unbecoming of a judge of a high court and was, thus, guilty of misconduct and he is, therefore, liable to be removed from his office under Article 209(6) of the Constitution,” the communication read.While addressing an audience at the bar, Justice Siddiqui had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.\n",
      "He had further claimed that the spy agency had approached IHC Chief Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi and said: “‘We do not want to let Nawaz Sharif and his daughter come out [of the prison] until elections, do not include Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on the bench [hearing Sharifs’ appeals]’.”Justice Siddiqui had offered no evidence to support the claims he made.\n",
      "The IHC judge was facing a reference over his controversial speech, the third reference filed against him.\n",
      "Earlier on July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments at the Rawalpindi District Bar Association by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.\n",
      "The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.\n",
      "The council did not consider another request of Justice Siddiqui to hold the proceedings of this reference in the open court.The judge had been alrea­dy facing a reference on misconduct earlier moved on the complaint by some retired employees of the Capital Development Authori­ty (CDA) for alleged refurbishment of his official residence beyond entitlement.\n",
      "Likewise, a similar show-cause notice was issued to Justice Siddiqui under Article 209 (5)(6) of the Constitution by the SJC on a reference moved by Advocate Kulsum Khaliq on behalf of former member of the National Asse­mbly Jamsh­ed Ahmed Dasti alleging that the high court judge had, during one of the hearings on a case relating to the 20-day Faizabad sit-in, objected to a compromise between the federal government and the protesting Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah. The compromise was facilitated by the armed forces.\n",

When a consensus was reached, then [the PPP] decided not to vote, which dispersed the opposition, and turned our hope — our decision to go into the parliament and turn the tables — into disappointment and despair.”\n",

      "Days after the controversy over horse-trading in the last Senate elections when lawmakers were accused of selling their votes, Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Nawab Taimur Talpur finally let the cat out of the bag when he admitted in the provincial assembly that his party had indulged in horse-trading. On Thursday, in a startling revelation, PPP lawmaker Taimur Talpur had confessed to horse-trading in the Senate elections in the huddle of the Sindh Assembly.\n",
      "Taimur said, “Senate polls witnessed horse-trading. The member who sold his vote to Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was also sitting in the House”.“We made a commitment that we won t ever discuss this,” said Nawab Muhammad Taimur Talpur in the Sindh Assembly.\n",
      "On the fourth day of the post-budget session, Talpur criticised members of the opposition for lashing out at the PPP’s policies. “They [opposition] are talking about corruption, loyalty and governance,” he began.\n",
      "“We know about your credibility. I personally know one of your opposition members who sold his vote in the last Senate election. He is still sitting on the opposition benches.”\n",
      "Talpur, who is the son of PPP MNA Nawab Yousuf Talpur, then lashed out at Abbasi. “Stop playing the devil’s game. You will be able to get the reserved seat for women again,” he quipped. This created uproar in the House, with members of the treasury and opposition screaming at each other.\n",
      "Talpur, however, continued his speech and pointing a finger at Abbasi, said, “She is crying now, but I want to disclose here that it is the PPP that has given a government job to Abbasi’s husband.”All hell seems to break loose over the latest statement and after a heated exchange with the treasury members, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and GDA lawmakers walked out of the session. Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari, who was chairing the session, directed Talpur to stick to the budget, but the damage had already been done.\n",
      "A ruckus erupted in Sindh Assembly soon after Talpur’s remarks as opposition’s lawmakers—who were left flabbergasted by the unforeseen disclosure—staged protest and urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Saqib Nisar to take suo motu notice and initiate a thorough probe into the matter.\n",
      "Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had both protested and expressed severe reservations over clandestine act of horse-trading in the Senate polls.\n",
      "Political and legal experts, however, believe that the ECP exercise of summoning politicians will bear no fruit as it will be difficult for the accusers to prove their allegations, particularly regarding the purchase of votes.\n",

      " Istanbul (August 10, 2018): President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to exchange gold and hard currency into lira on Friday as part of a “national battle” against economic enemies he said have irreparably ruptured ties with Ankara.\n",
      "The lira has long been falling on worries about Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy and worsening relations with the United States. That turned into a rout on Friday, with the lira diving as much as 18 percent at one point, the biggest one-day drop since Turkey’s 2001 financial crisis.\n",
      "The lira, which has lost more than 40 percent this year, hit a new record low after Trump took steps to punish Ankara in a wide-ranging dispute. He said he had authorized higher tariffs on imports from the United States’ NATO ally, imposing duties of 20 percent on aluminum and 50 percent on steel.“The dollar cannot block our path. Don’t worry,” Erdogan told a crowd in the northeastern city of Bayburt.\n",
      "“However, I say it once again from here, if there is anyone who has dollars or gold under their pillows, they should go exchange it for liras at our banks. This is a national, domestic battle,” he said.\n",
      "“This will be my people’s response to those who have waged an economic war against us.”Erdogan’s comments offered no support for the currency, which fell as he spoke. A nearly hour-long presentation on Turkey’s new economic policy by Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak – Erdogan’s son-in-law – also did little to limit the currency’s free-fall.\n",
      "Without naming countries, Erdogan said supporters of a failed military coup two years ago, which Ankara says was organized by a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, were attacking Turkey in new ways since his re-election two months ago.\n",
      "“Some countries have engaged in behavior that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice,” Erdogan said. “Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging.”Turkey was facing artificial financial volatility, Erdogan said, and people should look to the “big picture” instead of foreign exchange prices.\n",
      "Turkey had made important progress with other countries, he said, naming Iran, Russia, China and “some European countries”, Erdogan said, adding that increasing production, exports and employment was the best response to the country’s challenges.\n",
      "“Don’t get too excited…You will not be able to topple this nation,” he told the crowd of supporters in Bayburt.\n",

NA-131 was snatched by PTI Chief  from PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique with a close margin in the July 25 elections.\n",
      "The petition was filed by Imran Khan’s lawyer Babar Awan.\n",
      "Imran bagged the seat by securing 84313 and the runner-up Saad Rafique secured 83633 votes with the difference of 780.\n",
      "The LHC had also directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to restrain from issuing the notice of the success of the PTI chief until the process of the recount is completed. A Returning Officer had earlier dismissed the former railway’s minister’s plea of the recount of votes of the whole constituency.\n",
      "The ECP then accepted Rafique’s application but only allowed scrutiny of rejected votes. However, Khan remained the winning candidate and the PML-N leader’s effort could not bear fruit, leading him to file a petition in the high court.Now challenging the LHC orders, the prime minister-in-waiting has prayed to the Supreme Court that Rafique’s petition was inadmissible and the high court’s order was in contradiction with the law and the Constitution and hence must be declared null and void.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Khan’s party has expressed serious concerns over delays in announcing election results of the constituencies, currently being challenged at different levels.\n",
      "Withholding results of almost 20 constituencies due to administrative or legal reasons is extremely inappropriate, said a statement issued by PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry. “Votes in 48 constituencies have already been recounted,” it added.\n",

      " Karachi (August 03, 2018): Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Raza Rabbani on Friday demanded the Senate to be allowed to probe into malfunctioning of the software used during polls, which caused a delay in the election results.\n",
      "After the poll results were delayed, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had blamed a collapse in the Results Transmission System (RTS) for the unusual delay in the results on election day.\n",
      "In a statement to the media, Rabbani lashed out at the electoral body. He called the constitution of a committee by ECP to probe into the RTS-collapse incident a ‘mere sham.’\n",
      "“We reject the ECP Secretary Babar Yaqoob’s letter to constitute a probe committee,” Rabbani said. “Formation of a committee to probe into failure of the RTS system is a mere sham. The terms of reference (TORs) to form the committee are ambiguous and they ignore the main issue.”The PPP leader noted that TORs of the committee did not mention the statement of National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) that had said the system was functional.\n",
      "The former Senate chairman further noted that the General Election 2018 had fallen prey to pre-poll rigging. “The collapse of RTS has raised questions on the entire election,” he said.\n",
      "“The failure of RTS has given way to political instability at the centre,” Rabbani said. “We demand that the Senate be allowed to investigate the matter.”\n",
      "On Thursday, ECP asked the Cabinet Division to constitute a committee to probe the malfunction of the software that was transmitting election results. The electoral body asked for technical representatives from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and National Telecom and Information Technology Security Board to be included in the committee.The commission further recommended that the committee should present a report on the matter within a month.\n",
      "ECP secretary Babar Yaqoob on July 26 had said that the delay has not been caused by any ‘wicked conspiracy’ or pressure. He had stated that the poll results had been delayed due to the result transmission system malfunction while data was being entered into it.\n",
      "Political parties, including the PPP and the PML-N, have since demanded a parliamentary commission into the matter while Nadra officials have denied that the RTS crashed on election eve. They instead went on to claim that it could have been the commission’s Result Management System (RMS) that may have crashed adding that Nadra received results from around 50 per cent of polling stations before the commission directed its officers to stop using RTS.\n",
      "The ECP has continued to insist that the delay in announcement of results, which had cast doubts on the fairness of the entire electoral process, had been because of the fault in RTS.\n",

      "The note said that contempt proceedings against Chaudry should be taken up in compliance with Article 204. which deals with contempt of court against a high court or the Supreme Court, Murtaza informed the court.\n",

      " Islamabad(July 26, 2018): The chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, Michael Gahler, has said that apart from a few incidents of terrorism, the overall situation of the general election was satisfactory.\n",
      "“Our observers visited as many as 300 polling stations in 87 constituencies and I have personally visited four polling stations. Though we will release our preliminary report on Friday and a detailed report will be released later after assessing the overall situation, there is improvement as compared to the previous election held in 2013,” he said while talking to reporters outside Ammar Khan Shaheed Model School for Boys in Sector G-10/3 on Wednesday.He said that as many as 50 recommendations were given by the mission after the 2013 elections, out of which 36 were implemented or included in the electoral law.\n",
      "When asked that some political parties were complaining that they were not given a level playing field, Mr Gahler said that the mission could not get access for a month due to which it was mostly depending on media reports.\n",
      "He said that according to his assessment, the army was deployed under a code of conduct and it was strictly following it.\n",
      "Mr Gahler also visited a polling station and asked a number of questions from presiding officer Muhammad Yousuf, who is a faculty member at the Federal Urdu University.\n",
      "Earlier, while visiting Islamabad Model College for Girls F-6/2, Mr Gahler said that as many as 60 EU observers were working across the country, apart from Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).“We have observed smooth polling and many of our recommendations seem to be implemented and the security situation seems improved.

      " Washington (July 19, 2018): United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he holds his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin personally responsible for Moscow’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 US election.\n",
      "Trump said he would consider Putin culpable because he’s Russia’s leader. I would because he’s in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country,” Trump said. “So certainly as the leader of the country you would have to hold him responsible.”Trump ultimately walked back the answer he gave at the joint news conference in Helsinki, and attributed his comments to a simple mistake.\n",
      "“In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t,'” Trump said on Tuesday. He explained he had reviewed a transcript and video of his remarks. “The sentence should have been: ‘I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia,’ ” he said. “Sort of a double negative.”The White House was once again sent into clean-up mode Wednesday when Trump said “no” when a reporter asked him if Russia was still targeting the United States. Press secretary Sarah Sanders later claimed Trump was saying “no” to answering questions, not to whether the Russians are targeting the US.\n",
      "When pressed in his Wednesday interview on whether his acceptance of the US intelligence analysis meant that he thought Putin lied when denying any Russian involvement, Trump said he “didn’t want to get into whether or not he’s lying.”“I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted,” Trump said. He said his message to Putin warning against future interference was “very strong” during their meeting Monday.“I let him know we can’t have this. We’re not going to have it. And that’s the way it’s going to be,” Trump said.\n",
      "Trump also said once again that he wants to sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election and Russians’ ties to the Trump campaign. “I’ve always wanted to do an interview, because look, there’s been no collusion,” Trump said.\n",

      " Islamabad(April 16, 2018): World Bank expects expenditures would be higher because of the election year while more draw down in foreign exchange reserves expected because of the ballooning current account deficit but it would partly be offset due to higher foreign direct investment expected to increase owing to CPEC related project.\n",
      "The twice a year report prepared by the World Bank under the theme of South Asia Economic Forum which narrated that upcoming national election in 2018 may affect the reform momentum and macroeconomic policy. Slower progress in much-need reforms would weaken growth prospects and discourage private investment, the report said.The World Bank said that on the supply side, the impetus to growth is projected to come from the services and the industrial sectors. On the demand side, acceleration would be driven by public and private consumption, aided by a moderate increase in investment.\n",
      "The pressure on the current account is expected to persist as the trade deficit will remain elevated during FY2018 and FY2019. This situation can potentially become unsustainable in absence of corrective policy measures. However, exports are expected to recover during Fiscal Year 2018 and Fiscal Year 2019 due to an easing of supply-side factors. Imports, after strong growth of 17.7 percent in FY2017, are expected to grow at a slower pace in FY2018 and FY2019.\n",
      "Remittances will continue to partly finance the current account deficit. It is also expected that FDI flows will strengthen due to the accelerated implementation of CPEC projects. However, capital and financial flows during FY2018 and FY2019 will only partly finance the current account deficit, which will result in a drawdown of reserves during these two years.\n",
      "Fiscal slippages are expected to continue through the election cycle, which will result in a widening of the fiscal deficit during FY2018. This increase in the fiscal deficit is primarily driven by a slower increase in government tax revenues (both federal and provincial) and a sharper increase in expenditures.An adjustment in the fiscal position in FY2019 after the election will help in curtailing the fiscal deficit.\n",
      "Inflation, after remaining moderate during FY2017, is expected to rise in FY2018 and FY2019. Inflation is expected to rise due to higher domestic demand pressures and a slight increase in international oil prices.\n",
      "Macroeconomic risks have increased substantially during FY2017. The external balance is particularly vulnerable given the persistent current account deficit, affecting the country reserve position. Improving the external balance hinges upon a revival in exports, a slowdown in imports, and stable remittance flows. In absence of any of these factors, the persistent current account deficit will put further pressure on already dwindling reserves.\n",
      "The fiscal position is also expected to deteriorate during the election cycle, which would affect debt trends and maintain debt at the current high level. The quitting of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has enhanced political risks and created some policy uncertainty.\n",

      "Farooq Sattar submitted his petition through his counsel Advocate Babar Sattar having the stance that the Election Commission decision regarding intra-party election and MQM convener-ship against the law and it should be termed null and void.ECP Removes Sattar as MQM-P Convener\n",
      "The ECP on Monday had removed Sattar from the position of MQM-P convener by accepting the challenge to his election and rejected his plea that the ECP had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon internal matters of the party.\n",
      "A five-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, had annulled the intra-party elections of the MQM-P held under Dr Sattar’s leadership that he claimed to have won with a huge margin.\n",
      "The petitions assailing his position had been filed by Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Kanwar Naveed Jameel, leaders of MQM-P Bahadur­abad — a rival faction of the Dr Sattar-led PIB group.The commission had also accepted a petition challenging the resolution passed at an “emergency general workers’ meeting” called by Dr Sattar last month. At the convention, when he had asked the participants through a resolution if they would endorse the coordination committee’s decision to remove him from the position of the convener, the workers had replied in the negative.Following the ECP’s judgement, Dr Sattar had told the media that the decision would be remembered as a ‘dark verdict’. He had ter­med the judgement “illegal and unconstitutional” and said the commission had never issued judgements on intra-party disputes in the past.\n",
      "“I have been punished for standing against MQM foun­der Altaf Hussain on Aug 23 [2016],” Dr Sattar had said, referring to the day when he announced parting ways with Hussain over his incendiary speech, “and for standing alongside Pakis­tan, Consti­tution and the Pakistani state”.\n",

This was followed with a more in-depth analysis of behavioral dynamics at work in key seats which in turn informed the party’s efforts to ensure a local structure and communication strategy that matched the caste make-up and attitudinal positions of the pre-identified ‘swing population’.”\n",
      "In 2007, SCL worked in Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, on a “communication campaign to support a trans-national programme for countering the Non-Desired Behaviour of recruitment into, and support of, violent Jihadism. The project focused on ancillary populations as opposed to perpetrators of violent Jihadism themselves and required an in-depth motivational understanding of the populations of six states”.In 2007, the firm worked in Uttar Pradesh and carried out a full political survey “on behalf of a major party”.\n",
      "In the 2010 Bihar state election, the firm was asked to provide electoral research and strategy for the Janata Dal (United).\n",
      "Wylie also says in 2012, “SCL India carried out a caste census in Uttar Pradesh on behalf of a national party. The research included analysis of caste structure and dynamics within the state leading to conclusions regarding the identification of the party’s core voters as well as likely swing voters.”\n",
      "Wylie’s tweeted document also says in 2011 Uttar Pradesh, SCL India undertook a statewide (200mn people) research campaign to identify voter caste by household. This booth level polling data formed the basis of further research into swing voters motivation and supporter mobilization strategies, which were presented to individual candidates and tailored to their constituencies.\n",
      "In the 2009 general elections, SCL India managed the campaigns of a number of Lok Sabha candidates. The research and campaign teams employed SCL India’s proprietary data collection methodologies to form strategies that gave the clients successful election campaigns.\n",

      "“To hold that a person who is disqualified to be king can nevertheless be given a freehand to operate as a kingmaker, who may despite lacking qualification and without going through the electoral process, act as a puppet master pull the strings and exercise political power vicariously would amount to making a complete mockery of the Constitution, the legislative process, the law, the government and values that we hold so dear and have consciously worked for, defended and incorporated in the Constitution,” the judgment stated further.The judgement also discusses allegations against Sharif that stemmed from Panama Papers revelations about offshore companies of the then ruling family and that became basis for his disqualification as prime minister.\n",
      "The judgment has said further that if sections 203 and 232 of the law are read independently of the Constitution, it would be like opening the doors to control of political parties through remote control.\n",

      " Islamabad (February 17, 2018): The term “horse trading” always circulated when the senate election held, however this time the echo of buying and sell of parliamentarians with offers of millions of rupees has engulfed the senate polls before time.\n",
      "The dismantling of ruling party PML-N government in Balochistan and rift among the MQM-P leaders, that clearly divided the party in tow groups, have paved the way of horse trading in upcoming senate polls that will be held on March 3.From the prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to other politicians every one talking about the horse trading that has rung the bell of aggravation of the situation. The politicians either side of the parliament- Ruling or Opposition benches- are blaming to each other for horse trading.The Balochistan is more on crosshairs of horse trading after the toppling of PML-N majority government that can lead defeat of PML-N in Balochistan and likely horse trading will work here.\n",
      "The other likely epicenter of horse trading is Federally Administrative Tribal Areas (FATA) where only 11 senators will elect four senators, it means a aspirant needs only support of four senators to become the member of upper house. It means, if only six out of 11 decided the priority list of aspirants they can become successful to elect their favourit candidates.Amid the echoes of horse trading former chairman senate Waseem Sajjad has given suggestion that if someone wanted to stop horse trading in senate polls the direct election should be the possible way to get rid of this menace.\n",
      "Some analysts have the view that secret balloting is another tool to help boost the horse trading. In this process a member parliament, particularly MPAs, is compelled to vote for his party aspirant in his first priority, however he can vote on second priority list to the candidate who is nearest to his heart or pocket.Another major fault of present procedure of electing senate member is how to find out the voter who is indulged in horse trading. On the other hand leader of the opposition Aitzaz Ahsan  opposed the direct election for senate and urged some other ways to handle the issue.\n",

      " Web Desk (February 11, 2018): The Maldives is engulfed in a deepening political crisis, as the introduction of a state of emergency decree across the holiday islands prompted heavily-armed troops to storm the country’s top court and arrest a former president.\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "In an unexpected move last week, the Maldives Supreme Court ordered the release of several imprisoned opposition lawmakers, ruling that their trials were politically motivated.President Abdulla Yameen refused to comply with the decision and instead imposed a state of emergency for a period of 15 days. This afforded him sweeping powers to send security forces into the Supreme Court building in the capital city of Male on Monday\n",
      "Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Judge Ali Hameed were both arrested in the early hours of Tuesday, local police said via Twitter, although charges were not specified. Their detention was soon followed by the arrest of Yameen’s estranged half-brother, former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom — who had ruled the country for more than 30 years until a transition to democracy in 2008.What’s the background?\n",
      "Gayoom, who has sided with the opposition party since leaving office a decade ago, has been a vocal critic of the current president. He was succeeded by Mohamed Nasheed in 2009, who served during a brief period of multiparty democracy before being controversially ousted five years after taking office.\n",
      "Nasheed was internationally recognized for his efforts in addressing the impact of climate change on the Maldives. However, he was imprisoned in 2015 on terrorism charges — which his supporters say were contrived.\n",
      "Security forces stand outside Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) office as they barricade it,in the capital of the Maldives, Male on February 7, 2018. The Maldives president on February 7 welcomed a Supreme Court move to reinstate the convictions of high-profile political prisoners after he arrested two top judges and declared a state of emergency, plunging the upmarket holiday paradise into chaos.\n",
      "After being allowed to leave prison a year later on medical grounds, Nasheed was granted asylum in Britain. He was reportedly expected to challenge Yameen in presidential elections later this year, before the current political dispute triggered the ensuing crisis.\n",
      "Yameen has been in power since 2013, following a disputed election that his opponents claim was rigged. Since then, he has been accused of jailing critics, cracking down on dissent and ultimately eroding the country’s democratic process.How has the world reacted?\n",
      "Both former leaders of the Maldives, Nasheed and Gayoom, have called on India to force Yameen to release the recently jailed high court judges and political prisoners. While intervention from New Delhi would certainly be unusual, it is not unprecedented. India sent troops to the Maldives in 1988 to foil a coup.\n",
      "Alongside India, the U.S. and the U.K. have both urged Yameen to honor the rule of law and free the detainees.\n",
      "The U.S. State Department said in a statement: “President Yameen has systematically alienated his coalition, jailed or exiled every major opposition political figure, deprived elected members of parliament of their right to represent their voters in the legislature, revised laws to erode human rights… and weakened the institutions of government.”Meanwhile, the United Nations (UN) human rights chief warned Wednesday that Yameen’s state of emergency decree, which had been used to imprison perceived political opponents, was undermining the checks and balances necessary in any functioning democracy.\n",
      "“The suspension of several functions of the judiciary and parliament, and the restrictions on a series of constitutional rights, create a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of the president,” Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said in a statement.Is it safe to travel?\n",
      "The Maldives is a hugely popular tourist destination, especially among Chinese and British visitors, and the latest turmoil comes amid peak tourism season for the tropical islands.\n",
      "Nearly 1.4 million tourists worldwide traveled to the Indian Ocean islands in 2017, according to government statistics. In 2016, Reuters reported that the Maldives earned $2.7 billion from holidaymakers visiting luxury hotels and scuba-diving resorts.\n",
      "On Tuesday, the Maldives Ministry of Foreign Affairs attempted to reassure vacationers that the situation remained calm and would not affect tourism.\n",
      "However, in the wake of the latest political crisis, the U.S., China, India and the U.K. have all issued advisories against traveling to the Maldives.\n",

      " Web Desk (january 1, 2018): As the New Year approaches, it seems like every year is dubbed “a year like no other.” But 2017 truly was more dramatic than many other years in recent memory.\n",
      "In the last 12 months, we faced a renewed threat of nuclear war, debated whether to take a knee during the national anthem and resisted the temptation to look at the sun during the total solar eclipse.\n",
      "From increased tensions with North Korea, to a hurricane season unlike any other, to the bombshell allegations of sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond, take a look back at the key moments of 2017.\n",
      "1.Donald Trump: Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20, outlining his vision of a new national populism and reiterating the same “America First” mantra that delivered the White House to him during the 2016 election.\n",
      "In his first address as leader of the free world, Trump said his inauguration would signify a historic moment when “the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”\n",
      "After months on the campaign trail marked by partisan division and deep skepticism from his critics, Trump told thousands in the nation’s capital that his agenda was for every American — even as protesters demonstrated against him elsewhere in Washington, D.C., including some who clashed with police hours later.\n",
      "The next day, half a million marchers demonstrated for gender equality and against the new president during the Women’s March on Washington, brandishing pink hats and homemade signs in the streets near the National Mall.\n",
      "Now more than a year since his election, Trump is enjoying a healthy economy marked by lower unemployment numbers and strong stock market performance.\n",

      "Kim Im Ryong, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, bluntly warned that the Trump administration’s tough talk was creating “a dangerous situation in which thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.”\n",
      "The situation has become so dire that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked China — Pyongyang’s neighbor and most powerful ally — to “use their influence to convince or compel North Korea to rethink its strategic calculus.”\n",
      "Tensions escalated in June when Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American student, died days after being released from a North Korean prison in an unconscious state.\n",

      "In late March, three people were killed and about 40 were injured when an attacker rammed into pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge and attempted to enter Parliament wielding a knife. About two weeks later, an attacker killed four and injured 15 after intentionally driving into a department store in Stockholm, Sweden.\n",
      "In May, children were among the 22 killed in a suicide bombing after an Ariana Grande concert at Britain’s Manchester Area. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since 2005. Almost two weeks later, seven people died and nearly 50 were injured when a vehicle rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge, and three attackers embarked on a stabbing spree at nearby Borough Market.\n",
      "During August, 13 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in Spain when a van plowed into Barcelona’s La Rambla tourist destination, before another car hit several people and killed one woman in a resort further down the Spanish coast.\n",
      "Terrorism again hit the U.S. on Oct. 31, when Sayfullo Saipov rented a pickup truck and deliberately mowed down pedestrians on a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight and injuring about a dozen more, before crashing into a school bus.

      "7. The Opioid Epidemic:\n",
      "In August, President Trump declared America’s opioid epidemic a national emergency two days after vowing the U.S. would “win” the fight against it.\n",
      "About a month earlier, the Department of Justice charged more than 400 people who officials said were preying on addicts to shell out money for unnecessary treatments that only worsened their condition, and doctors who were allegedly prescribing unnecessary opioids.\n",
      "The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently reported that the epidemic’s true cost in 2015 was $504 billion — more than six times the most recent estimate.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in late October that illegal, lab-made fentanyl contributed to the death of at least half of fatal opioid overdoses in 2016, underscoring how deadly the epidemic has become in recent years.\n",
      "8.The Devastating Hurricane Season:A hurricane season unlike any other came to a close in December after causing billions of dollars in damages, devastating those who were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria when they plowed through southeast Texas, Florida and the Caribbean.\n",
      "Harvey, a Category 3 storm, drenched southeast Texas in late August with 1 million gallons of water per person in the region, according to The Associated Press. The storm caused historic flooding in Houston, where some downtown areas were knee-deep in water and portions of highways were shut down with 10 feet of water.\n",
      "Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Irma ravaged Florida, devastating the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm before weakening. The storm also lead to the deaths of 12 patients at a Hollywood, Florida, nursing home. Those fatalities have since been ruled a homicide, officials said.\n",
      "And at the end of September, the Category 4 Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in almost a century, steamrolled through the island, annihilating homes, knocking out the entire power grid and leaving many without electricity for months.\n",
      "Maria’s aftermath also raised concerns about the relationship between Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and the small Montana energy firm that was helping Puerto Rico to rebuild its power grid, Whitefish Energy Holdings.\n",
      "The island canceled its $300 million contract with the company in October after The Washington Post reported, among other things, that the company only had only two full-time employees when the storm made landfall\n",
      "9.The Total Solar Eclipse:The astronomical phenomenon of the century lived up to the hype.The total solar eclipse shifted across the U.S. in late August, enchanting Americans in small towns and large stadiums from coast to coast. The nation was captivated by the first total solar eclipse to cross the U.S. since 1918.\n",
      "viewers gazed at the eclipse as it carved a narrow “path of totality” from Salem, Oregon, to Charleston, South Carolina. The one rule was to look only through special glasses or projected reflections, but some — including the president — disregarded that sound advice.\n",
      "10.The Culture Wars:Since President Trump took office, the partisan division that evidenced on the campaign trail translated into national culture wars, including debates over the merits of removing statues and building names that honor Confederate soldiers, as well as kneeling at football games to protest racial inequality.\n",
      "On Aug. 12, white nationalists gathered in Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia, before a rally organized by a group known as “Unite the Right.” The rally’s purpose was to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n",
      "Later that day, a 32-year-old woman was killed and more than 19 others were injured after a car rammed into a group of counter-protesters who were demonstrating against the alt-right.\n",
      "Trump denounced the series of events that unfolded in Charlottesville, but was criticized by the public and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for not fully condemning the protests’ white nationalist elements, which included appearances by former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke and white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.\n",

      "“Our forces have the capability to clear the area but we are keeping the operation as the last option. This is not a sign of weakness but we are doing this out of respect [for the matter of finality of Prophethood].”\n",
      "He accused the protesters of Islamabad sit-in of inciting people through propaganda on social media, rejecting the impression that government has allowed any flexibility on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.\n",
      "“There is no lacuna in the law relating to Khatm-e-Nabuwwat,”\n",
      "The minister who was flanked by Peer Ameenul Hasnat, Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, said , “No government can compromise on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat. Khatm-e-Nabuwwat is part of our faith”\n",
      "The interior minister said the parliament and the people of the country were custodian of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.\n",
      "Ahsan Iqbal said inciting religious sentiments was not appropriate, adding that Pakistan’s enemies are taking advantage of the image created by the protesters.“We have showed restraint,”  he said in response to a question and appealed to the religious leaders to call off the sit-in as Islamabad was going to host foreign dignitaries at Joint Coordination Committee meeting on Monday.\n",
      "He said although the entire nation was united on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat, the protesters have created the impression though their sit-in that the nation was divided on the issue.\n",
      "The protest has nothing to do with religion or religious demands and “such organisations” take these steps to advance ahead of elections, he said.\n",
      "“The protesters’ demand that Law Minister Zahid Hamid step down; however, there is no proof that he is responsible for the mistake. A committee has been formed in this regard which will probe the matter so there is no justification for the protest,” he said.\n",
      "In response to a question, the minister said they have intelligence reports that some elements among the protesters want the government to take action so they can further their hidden agenda.He added that the government is fully capable of countering the protesters but is choosing restraint.\n",
      "The interior minister, began the news press by reiterating that the government firmly believes in the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat (finality of Prophethood) law, adding that Parliament and nation are united on the matter.\n",
      "“It is settled forever [for Pakistan] that a person who doesn’t believe in the finality of Prophethood has no right to call himself Muslim. All political parties unanimously passed the law in this regard. There is no justification now for the protest to continue,” he said.\n",
      "Calling upon protesters once again to call off the sit-in, he said that he hopes they will agree to the suggestions made by the religious personalities included in talks, adding that now he himself is conducting contempt of court by allowing the protest to continue.\n",
      "“I requested the court for more time all for good cause,” he said.At present, negotiations between a select group of religious leaders and the protesters are under way.\n",
      "The minister, along with others, has been engaged in negotiations with the protesters, who have occupied the key Faizabad Interchange of the capital for nearly two weeks, but failed to reach a breakthrough.\n",
      "However, addressing the media later Saturday night after hectic rounds of negotiations, Iqbal said he was hopeful of resolving the matter in a day.\n",
      "The religious parties have been protesting against the change in the finality of Prophethood oath in the law when the government passed the Elections Act 2017 last month. The change, dubbed a clerical error by the government, was immediately fixed as an amendment was passed later.However, the protesters have demanded that Law Minister Zahid Hamid, who introduced the bill, resign. They also want responsibility fixed on other officials involved in the incident.\n",
      "The protest has disrupted life in the capital and Rawalpindi, causing inconvenience as well as at least two reported casualties due to ambulances being unable to cross the protesters.\n",
      "The Islamabad High Court had given the government until 10am November 18 to remove the protesters ‘with force if need be’ but the government did not do so and instead opted for negotiations to find a peaceful way out.\n",
      "According to sources on Saturday night, the protesters have refused to budge from their demand for the law minister’s resignation, saying they will engage in talks once Hamid has been sacked.\n",
      "However, Iqbal said on Saturday the law minister will not be sacked until his guilt is proven.\n",

      " Karachi (November 17, 2017): The Sindh High Court has sought record of a trial court which exonerated former Interior minister Rahman Malik in dual nationality case.\n",
      "The court issued the direction in the case, filed by Election Commission seeking action against Rahman Malik for concealing his dual nationality.\n",
      "During today’s hearing the court expressed anger at Malik’s absence, on which Rahman’s counsel assured the court that his client will appear before the court on next hearing.Challenging the judgment of the Judge of Session Court Election Commission argues that Malik was exonerated by the Session Court ex parte.\n",
      "The Election Commission also pleads the Sindh High Court to declare Rahman Malik disqualified and to order him pay back the salaries and the benefits.It may be mentioned here that Pakistan’s Constitution bars a foreign national (or dual nationality holder) from holding any public office of the Government of Pakistan. The Supreme Court of Pakistan retroactively suspended and terminated the electoral membership of Farahnaz Ispahani over the issue of dual nationality on 25 May 2012.In a reference filed against Malik, the Supreme Court began the hearings against Malik over the suspicion of his British nationality. Effectively, the then chief justice Pakistan Iftikhar Chaudhry suspended the electoral membership of Malik when he had shown reluctance to submit a declaration by the United Kingdom’s Border Agency to establish that his client had surrendered British nationality on 6 June 2012. Despite the Supreme Court’s verdict, he was reinstated by Prime Minister Gillani after issuing directives to the cabinet division to reinstate him as an advisor to the prime minister on interior affairs.On 5 October 2012, Malik informed the Supreme Court that he had renounced his British citizenship on 25 March 2008.\n",
      "Shortly after the verdict, Malik tendered his resignation to the Senate to Chairman Senate on 10 July 2012. He continued his work with the Ministry of Interior at the behest of then prime minister Pervez Ashraf.On 4 June, his membership in the Senate was suspended by the Supreme Court for being a dual national. This resulted in the loss of his position as the Interior Minister, because Article 63-A of the Constitution of Pakistan requires each member of the cabinet to be a member of the Parliament. On 10 July 2012, Malik resigned from the Senate.\n",
      "It may be mentioned here that Rahman Malik took oath as Senator on in March 2015 and will complete his renure in March 2021.\n",

Deputy Commissioner Peshawar has banned brandishing and displaying of arms and rallies in the constituency by imposing Sec-144. Pilling riding and assembly of more than four people have also been banned.\n",

Both have pumped massive federal and provincial funds into NA-4 for launching new projects, or to complete the ongoing ones before schedule.

One side of the constituency connects to GT Road via Chamkani, while the other meets Pabbi, Nowshera. The area of Badbher connects the constituency with Khyber Agency, while the route of Mattani joins it to Darra Adam Khel in Frontier Region Kohat.The geographic location of the constituency and terrorism incidents that have taken place there in the past are the reason why all the polling stations there have been declared sensitive while 182 have been marked as ‘most sensitive’.The constituency is home to around 600,000 people who call it a hub of problems as gas and electricity load-shedding and lack of potable water and schools for girls have made their routine life difficult.\n",

      "Talking to media, the minister said that he stuck to his stance that Shahbaz should take over the party which he said is in the best interest of the party and country.\n",
      "“Shehbaz Sharif is an obedient brother and that’s why he said that he should take over the party and I still adhere to my statements,” said Pirzada.\n",
      "He said that there is no double meaning or conspiracy behind his words. Regarding criticism of his statement, he said that he did not call upon a Brigadier Shahbaz Sharif to take over or 111 brigade to take over PML-N rather an obedient brother of Nawaz Sharif to take charge of party.\n",
      "“We don’t object to Nawaz’s leadership but we are concerned how the party will go into the next elections,” said Pirzada.\n",

      " Tokyo (October 22, 2017): Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swept to a comfortable victory in a snap election on Sunday, handing him a mandate to harden his already hawkish stance on North Korea and re-energise the world’s number-three economy.\n",
      "Abe’s conservative coalition was on track to win 311 seats in the 465-seat parliament, according to a projection published by private broadcaster TBS, putting the nationalist blue blood on course to become Japan’s longest-serving leader.\n",
      "The comfortable election win is likely to stiffen Abe’s resolve to tackle North Korea’s nuclear menace, as the key US regional ally seeks to exert maximum pressure on the regime in Pyongyang after it fired two missiles over Japan in the space of a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abe was heading for a “landslide win,” the Yomiuri daily said on its website.\n",
      "Millions of Japanese braved torrential rain and driving winds to vote, as a typhoon bears down on the country with many heeding warnings to cast their ballots early.\n",
      "Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) benefitted from a weak and splintered opposition, with the two main parties facing him created only a matter of weeks ago.\n",
      "Support for the Party of Hope founded by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike fizzled after an initial blaze of publicity and was on track to win around 50 seats, the TBS projection suggested.\n",
      "Speaking from Paris where she was attending an event in her capacity as leader of the world’s biggest city, a sullen-faced Koike told public broadcaster NHK she feared a “very severe result”.\n",
      "The new centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party fared slightly better than expected but was still far behind Abe.\n",
      "It was unclear in the immediate aftermath of the vote whether Abe’s coalition would retain its two-thirds “supermajority.”\n",
      "Such a “supermajority” would allow Abe to propose changes to Japan’s US-imposed constitution that forces it to “renounce” war and effectively limits its military to a self-defence role.\n",
      "The short 12-day campaign was dominated by the economy and the global crisis over North Korea, which has threatened to “sink” Japan into the sea.\n",
      "Nationalist Abe stuck to a hardline stance throughout, stressing that Japan “would not waver” in the face of an increasingly belligerent regime in Pyongyang.\n",
      "Despite the sabre-rattling from North Korea, many voters said reviving the once-mighty Japanese economy was the top priority, with Abe’s trademark “Abenomics” policy failing to trickle down to the general public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three-pronged combination of ultra-loose monetary policy, huge government spending and structural reform has catapulted the stock market to a 21-year high but failed to stoke inflation and growth has remained sluggish.\n",
      "Although voters turned out in their millions to back Abe, support for the 63-year-old is lukewarm and surveys showed his decision to call a snap election a year earlier than expected was unpopular.\n",
      "Koike briefly promised to shake up Japan’s sleepy political scene with her new party but she declined to run herself for a seat, sparking confusion over who would be prime minister if she won.\n",
      "In the end, the 65-year-old former TV presenter was not even in Japan on election day.\n",
      "The campaign was marked by a near-constant drizzle in large parts of the country and rallies frequently took place under shelter and a sea of umbrellas.\n",
      "But this did not dampen the enthusiasm of hundreds of doughty, sash-wearing parliamentary hopefuls, who have driven around in minibuses pleading for votes via loudspeaker and bowing deeply to every potential voter.\n",

      "The notification violates Articles 15, 16, 17 and 19 of the Constitution, which guarantee every citizen the freedom of movement, assembly association and speech, his application said.The notification, he argued, is based on the assumption “that public office holders of a political party may indulge in corrupt or illegal practices” and “unduly influence the electorate” using public funds and resources and that the assumption cannot be used to strip a political party or a leader of their right to campaign.\n",
      "The application said that the commission can define guidelines which ensure transparent practices during election, but “cannot restrict political activity.”Malik is an MNA from NA-123 Lahore and is at the forefront of PML-N’s campaign to win back the seat left vacant after disqualification of Nawaz Sharif via the July 28 Panamagate verdict.\n",
      "A strong contest is expected in the constituency with the three biggest parties pushing for a win. Kulsoom is up against PTI’s Yasmeen Rashid and PPP’s Faisal Mir in the election, set to take place on September 17.\n",

      "By-polls in PS-114 constituency of Karachi, scheduled on July 9, has triggered the political temperature of the country.\n",
      "All the political parties are putting their full efforts and resources to convince 193,892 registered voters of the constituency. The by-election is being held after the victory of Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz’s Irfanullah Marwat was declared void by the election tribunal in July, 2014 after the runner-up, MQM’s Rauf Siddiqui challenged the result, alleging that the polls were rigged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marwat won the election with 37,130 votes, while runner-up Siddiqui secured 30,305 votes. Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had decided to re-poll in the constituency after National Database Registration Authority declared that above 17,000 fake votes were casted in the elections. Whereas the apex court uphold the ECP decision in May 2017. The seat had fallen vacant after the Supreme Court declared the election of PML-N’s Irfan Marwat from this constituency as null and void.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constituency, situated in Karachi’s District East, is both ethnically and religiously diverse. Stepping into PS-114 is like stepping into a mini Pakistan – people from all over the country have settled in the area. This includes Sindhis, Baloch, Saraikis, Punjabis, Pakhtuns and Urdu-speaking people. The constituency is consisted of Mahmudabad, Manzoor Colony, Chanesar Goth, Azam Basti, Junejo town and parts of Kashmir Colony.\n",
      "\n",
      "PML-N Irfanullah Marwat had won the elections in the constituency twice and MQM had won the seat once. It is pertinent to mention here that Irfanullah Marwat threw his weight behind Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s candidate Najeeb Haroon.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 32 candidates are contesting the election but the main combat is expected among the candidates of Pakistan Peoples Party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMN-N), MQM Pakistan and Jamat-e-Islami .\n",
      "\n",
      "Irfan Marwat had all set to join PPP but criticism of Asifa Bhutto Zardari and Bakhtawar Bhutto Zarda led him to change his decision. It seemed that Marwat took revenge by supporting PTI’s candidate in the by-polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "PPP’s Saeed Ghani making full efforts to win the by-polls so as to foil the perception that PPP could only win elections from Malir. Kemari and Lyari. It is last chance for MQM-Pakistan to show its powers. Irfan Marwat is an influence personality of the constituency and its support to PTI will play a vital role in the elections.\n",
      "The area is not only diverse ethnically but also boasts a wide variety of religious groups. The Christian community makes up more than 23% of the registered votes, with 30,000 residents and the Hindu community has another few thousand voters in the area. Minority votes will also play an important role in the by elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Candidates affiliated with different political parties have been winning election from PS-114 but non played his due role to serve the masses after reaching in assemblies. Despite whoever will win the by-election 2017, masses of the constituency amid heaps of garbage, over flowing gutters and dilapidated roads will think what they got?\n",

      "Known as the staunch supporter of Dalit rights, 71-year-old Kovind would become the country’s second Dalit president, after KR Narayanan, if he gets elected. His election is almost a certainty as the ruling bloc with the support of some regional parties enjoys a majority in the electoral college. Moreover, many parties would be reluctant in opposing a Dalit candidate being elected to the country’s highest office.\n",

      "Kovind’s selection was announced by BJP President Amit Shah following the party’s parliamentary board, which was attended by Modi and senior party leaders. Shah also sought support from opposition parties and said that the prime minister had spoken to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh.\n",
      "The Presidential election will be held on July 17 and the counting of votes will begin on July 20. The tenure of incumbent President Pranab Mukherjee’s term will come to an end on July 24.\n",
      "The Congress, however, refrained from commenting on the issue immediately and said the opposition would take a call on contesting the election after a meeting on June 22. “Congress does not want to comment on this issue as we want to take a unanimous decision with all other opposition parties on the presidential elections. The final call will be taken in a meeting of all opposition parties on June 22,” senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said. Describing the BJP’s attempt to reach out to the opposition as a “formality and a PR exercise”, Azad said the BJP should have built a consensus before announcing the candidate. “But they informed us after announcing this decision so there is no scope for consensus now… we were not expecting this from the ruling party. But it is their will, they are free to take a one-sided unilateral decision,” Azad added.\n",
      "The ruling TRS in Telangana and the Telugu Desam Party were among the first parties to have welcomed the decision and said they would support NDA’s presidential candidate Kovind. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urged opposition parties to rise above party politics and back the NDA nominee for the post of President. On the other hand, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed his happiness over Kovind’s candidature but stopped short of committing support to the NDA nominee.\n",
      "BSP leader Mayawati stated that her party would be positive provided the Opposition does not field any Dalit for the top post, while Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Kovind was chosen for the post just because he was the leader of Dalit Morcha of BJP.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the CPI called upon the Opposition parties to put up their candidate against Kovind as the NDA’s candidate for the post of president is from the ranks of RSS.\n",
      "Kovind, a lawyer-turned-politician, has been a champion of the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, OBC, minority and women’s rights from his student days. He served as the former president of the BJP Dalit Morcha from 1998 to 2002, besides being the party’s national spokesperson. He was also the chief of the All-India Koli Samaj.\n",

      " Lahore (June 16, 2017): Mohammad Amir is set to play in the Champions Trophy final against India on Sunday after recovering from a back spasm that forced the left-arm quick to sit-out the semi-finals against England.\n",
      "The fast bowler was seen practising at the Oval ground in London’s Kensington borough on Friday, two days ahead of the highly-anticipated final.\n",
      "Team administration confirmed that Amir has recovered and will play in the match this weekend when Pakistan will face title-holders and arch-rivals India.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Pakistan delivered an inspired all-round performance to rout a ragged England team by eight wickets in a one-sided in the semi-final.\n",
      "Pakistan bowled and fielded tightly to restrict the hosts to a paltry total of 211 all out and the lowest-ranked team in the tournament knocked off the runs in style with a massive 12.5 overs to spare.\n",
      "Amir’s likely availability could leave Pakistan with a conundrum, albeit a happy one. Despite bowling well, Amir was wicketless in the first two league matches, against India and South Africa. He had success against Sri Lanka, taking 2 for 53 and scoring a valuable 28 not out in an eighth-wicket partnership that sealed a semi-final place for Pakistan.\n",
      "In the semi-final, Amir was replaced by Rumman Raees, another left-arm fast bowler who made his ODI debut in the match; he shared the new ball with Junaid Khan and took 2 for 44 in Pakistan’s eight-wicket victory.\n",
      "Along with Hasan Ali, who has emerged as Pakistan’s bowler of the tournament, Raees and Junaid surprised England, dismissing one of the best batting units over the last two years for 211. Hasan, who suffered a calf niggle in the semi-final, did not train with the team on Friday but the authorities said that said the bowler was resting as a precaution.\n",

      " London (June 9, 2017): Sterling dived and the FTSE share index was set to fall 1 per cent on Friday after a shockingly bad election result for Prime Minister Theresa May plunged Britain into political chaos days before the start of Brexit talks.\n",
      "The surprise of a result that raises questions about how Britain will advance with its plan to leave the European Union, and whether any party can form a stable government, initially sank the pound by 2pc against both the dollar and euro.\n",
      "\n",
      "With May’s ability to form a government uncertain for much of the night, the pound steadied in Asian trading before falling sharply again as London traders arrived at their desks around 0530 GMT.\n",
      "British gilt yields also fell as investors sought the security of government bonds in the face of the uncertainty while spreadbetters predicted London’s main FTSE 100 stock exchange index would fall 1 percent at the opening.\n",
      "By 0530 GMT, sterling was 1.5pc lower on the day at $1.2753 ─ having fallen as low as $1.2693 ─ and 87.78 pence per euro.\n",
      "Falls for sterling have tended to support London’s internationally-focused FTSE 100 blue chip index. With trading volumes still extremely thin, official FTSE futures were up around 0.2pc, having earlier fallen by a similar amount.\n",

      "An up-to-5-percentage-point fall in gilt yields, however, suggested shocked investors would seek the security of bonds when markets reopened properly in London.\n",
      "Investors’ traditional views of whether the Conservatives or Labour would be good or bad for the pound, have been muddied in this election, not least by the prospect of Brexit talks due to start on June 19.\n",
      "Some banks have said a high-spending Labour government could spur economic growth and cause the Bank of England to raise interest rates more quickly.\n",
      "Some also argue that any Labour-led coalition might aim for a softer deal on Britain’s planned departure from the European Union than the “hard Brexit” that markets have worried May would deliver.\n",

      " Tehran (May 19, 2017): Iran will hold 12th presidential elections today, while the election is now a two-man race between President Hassan Rouhani and Ebrahim Raisi, the candidate who is closest to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n",
      "Past week polling showed Rouhani over the 50 percent threshold, which he needed to win, but also showed that almost 50 percent of voters were either undecided or didn’t express their preferences.\n",
      "The election results are anything but a foregone conclusion. Those who call these elections window dressing will continue to miss both the intricate politics on display and the underlying issues that inform them.\n",
      "This is the first election after the death of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in January. Rafsanjani and another former president, Mohammad Khatami, established a moderate coalition — supported by a wide range of political parties — to oppose hard-liners, gradually becoming a diverse power block. This coalition led to Rouhani’s surprising presidential victory in 2013, as well as successful candidates in parliamentary elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "But some say that Rafsanjani was merely using the reformists in his power struggle with Khamenei. Now, the reformists could improve their relationship with Khamenei directly without having to go through Rafsanjani. In the weeks that followed Rafsanjani’s death, Eshaq Jahangiri — the current vice president who withdrew his candidacy for president Tuesday — met with Khamenei and announced that he would act as the link between the leader and the reformists.\n",
      "As the leader of the reformists, Khatami also called for a “national reconciliation” to publicly bring together reformists and hard-liners together against the possibility of external threats. Khamenei rejected this idea, and said he saw no need for it. While these are weak signs, Khamenei’s victory over the reformists over the past decade may have given him the confidence to open up some kind of rapprochement in the future.\n",
      "With rumors surrounding the health of the 78-year-old Khamenei, political actors in Iran have begun to consider his possible successor. Based on the makeup of its executive committee, the current Assembly of Experts — which could choose the next supreme leader — is closely aligned with Khamenei. Khamenei had been a two-term president and a member of the Assembly of Experts when chosen as leader in 1989 — an experience that parallels Rouhani’s.\n",
      "Khamenei’s death would end his control over an Assembly of Experts that contains many clerics that came to power in 2016 through the Rafsanjani/Khatami-engineered reformist-centrist alliance, enabling a Rouhani run for the leadership position.\n",
      "For the central command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), it’s important that when there is a change in leadership in Iran, the reformists not gain significant power. A second term for Rouhani poses a threat to them. This explains why the IRGC backed the candidacy of Raisi, the trustee of one of the richest religious sites in the Shiite world who has held important positions in the judiciary and is a member of the Assembly of Experts. Raisi represents the most radical religious parts of Iran and those most loyal to Khamenei.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he becomes the next president, Raisi will be well positioned to become Khamenei’s successor. In that case, his proximity to the leadership and his position in the assembly may even create a situation like that of Cuba in 2008, where the successor became the face of the country’s leadership even though the leader was still alive and in power.\n",
      "But the same dynamic applies to Rouhani, who will lose his chance of becoming the next leader if he loses the presidential election, no matter who controls the next administration. However, if he wins by more than 20 million votes, Rouhani will be in a strong position for leadership in a post-Khamenei Iran.\n",
      "Iran’s unemployment crisis is the single most important campaign issue this election. Rouhani’s opponents use it to criticize his handling of Iran’s post-nuclear agreement economy. While the economic crisis is real — and its roots go further back than the nuclear issue — no candidate, regardless of their political leaning, will be in a position to solve it in a short time span.\n",
      "In a year of regional turmoil and uncertain relations with the new US administration, the elections on May 19 are of crucial importance both for the future status of the supreme leader and the survival of President Rouhani and the reform movement. The result may prove to be a more serious challenge than the establishment can muster.\n",

      "The election is seen as the most important in France for decades with two diametrically opposed views of Europe and France’s place in the world at stake.\n",
      "The National Front’s Le Pen would close borders and quit the euro currency, while independent Macron, who has never held elected office, wants closer European cooperation and an open economy.

      "The showing is Macron’s best in a voting survey by a major polling organisation since nine other candidates were eliminated in the first round on April 23.\n",
      "The survey was carried out after a rancorous final televised debate between the two contenders on Wednesday, which Macron was seen by French viewers as having won, according to two polls.\n",

      "The anti-immigration, anti-EU Le Pen was not giving up. “My goal is to win this presidential election,” she said on RTL radio. “The choices of Mr. Macron are choices which would lead to the end of our country as we know it, the end by being submerged by migration, which he will not oppose given his submission to the policy of Mrs (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel, the choice of the social devastation of deregulation, of ultra-flexibility which will mean war by everybody against everybody else.”\n",

      "The poll for Franceinfo radio showed 69 percent of abstaining voters will do so reluctantly, refusing to choose between Macron and Le Pen. Many voted for the more leftist candidates eliminated in the first round.\n",

      " NEW YORK (May 03, 2017): Democratic Party’s nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton delivered her most forceful critique of President Donald Trump’s victory on Tuesday, taking personal responsibility for her failed campaign but also pointed to the timing of a letter from FBI Director James Comey and Russian interference as factors.\n",
      "“If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,” she said in an interview to a US news channel at a Women for Women event in New York.\n",
      "“I take absolute personal responsibility. I was the candidate, I was the person who was on the ballot. I am very aware of the challenges, the problems, the shortfalls that we had,” Clinton said, before adding that she was “on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.”\n",
      "Clinton, who is currently writing a book that partly reflects on her 2016 loss, added, “The reason I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.”\n",
      "The event marks the latest where Clinton, in a stinging rebuke to Trump, both blames herself for the 2016 loss but also casts the current President as someone aided by outside factors, including the Russian government.\n",
      "Clinton noted that the 3 million more votes she won than Trump. “Fine. Better than the interfering in foreign affairs,” Clinton said. “If he wants to tweet about me than I am happy to be the diversion because we have lot of things to worry about. He should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote than doing some other things that would be important for the country.”\n",
      "Clinton, aides and friends say, has grown more at peace with her loss in recent months, but is still focused on the interference by the Russian government, especially the fact that WikiLeaks began releasing John Podesta’s hacked emails hours after the damaging “Access Hollywood” Trump tape was released.\n",
      "Clinton, as she has done in the past, also hung part of her 2016 loss on misogyny. “Yes, I do think it played a role. I think other things did as well,” Clinton said.\n",
      "But repeatedly, Clinton came back to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s role in the 2016 election and how he was able to tilt the scale in favor of Trump and against her.\n",
      "Clinton, aides say, sees her role during the Trump years as a political activist who speaks out when issue she cares about are threatened. And on Tuesday, it was clear Clinton was ready to settle into that role.\n",
      "“I am now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,” Clinton said, drawing cheers from the crowd that included former aides, donors and celebrities like actress Meryl Streep.\n",
      "The former secretary of state also pledged to “publicly request” that the Trump administration “not end our efforts making women’s rights and opportunities” central to US policy.\n",
      "Clinton praised Defense Secretary James Mattis for making the case for maintaining US foreign aid funding, despite a budget request by Trump that would cut it.\n",
      "“I am hoping that because of voices like Jim Mattis and others that that will begin to influence the administration,” she said.\n",
      "And on North Korea, Clinton cautioned Trump against giving too much away by saying he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un under the right circumstances.\n",
      "“I don’t believe that we alone are able to really put the pressure on this North Korean regime that needs to be placed,” she said. “Now the North Koreans are always interested … in trying to get Americans to try to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position and we should be very careful about giving that way.”\n",
      "Clinton said such negotiations could make it harder to work out a solution with countries in the region.\n",
      "Clinton will also speak on Tuesday at a Planned Parenthood 100-year anniversary gala, where she is expected to slam Trump’s handling of women health issues during his first months in office, including attempts to defund the women’s health organization.\n",
      "Planned Parenthood has been vocal in their opposition to Trump, slamming many of his appointees and the Republican plan to defund the organization.\n",
      "Both venues offer Clinton the opportunity to comment on Trump’s first 100 days in office and organizers at Planned Parenthood expect the 45th President will come up in the former Democratic nominee’s speech.\n",
      "Since spending months out of the limelight after the 2016 campaign, Clinton has re-emerged onto the public stage as the Republican Party grapples with Trump and the Democratic Party searches for a leader.\n",
      "In a series of speeches, Clinton has shown a willingness to knock the President, as was on display at Tuesday’s interview.\n",
      "In March, Clinton called the Trump-backed health care bill “disastrous” and knocked the plan for doing away with a maternity care requirement in health care.\n",
      "“Really? Take away maternity care?” Clinton said during her keynote address at the annual conference hosted by the Professional BusinessWomen of California. “Who do these people talk to?”\n",
      "And in April, Clinton told another group of women that she is “deeply concerned” with how Russia meddled into the 2016 election.\n",
      "“A foreign power meddled with our election and did so in a way that we are learning more about every single day,” she said.\n",
      "She also added that it was “somewhat gratifying” to see Trump mystified about how complex health care is.\n",
      "“You know, health care is complicated. Right?” Clinton said in a jab at Trump. “That was somewhat gratifying.”\n",
      "The small group of aides who are still in regular contact with Clinton stress, though, that the recent uptick in Trump criticism does not mean the former secretary of state is on a comeback. Clinton, they say, has remained in touch with an array of groups and while it may appear she is growing more political, the speeches don’t foretell a more forceful jump back into the political fray.\n",
      "The aides say that Clinton will knock the Trump administration when she sees fit — as evidenced by an April broadside against White House press secretary Sean Spicer after he chided a black female journalist for shaking her head at a news conference.\n",
      "“Too many women have had a lifetime of practice taking this kind of indignity in stride,” Clinton said.\n",
      "But they say the former secretary of state is more interested in helping the Democratic Party in 2018 and beyond then resuscitating her own political career.\n",

      " MOSCOW: United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday that relations with Moscow are at a low point after meetings in Russia that seemed to do little to bridge a deepening diplomatic divide over a chemical attack in Syria.\n",
      "Relations are “at a low point, there is a low level of trust between our two countries,” Tillerson said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tillerson and Lavrov spoke to the press after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in an extended display of US-Russian disagreements over the chemical attack that left more than 80 dead; the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s future; US actions in the Middle East; and Russian involvement in the US election.\n",
      "The news conference came after Lavrov issued a warning to Tillerson Wednesday against any further US strikes on the Syrian regime. Russia is Syria’s most powerful ally.\n",
      "The two top diplomats had sat down together earlier in the day to work through the fallout of last week’s chemical attack in northwestern Syria, which plunged the old Cold War enemies to a new low.\n",
      "Moscow and Washington have traded barbs over last week’s chemical attack, which killed 89 people, and prompted the US to carry out its first strike against the Syrian regime in the six-year conflict, taking out aircraft and infrastructure at a Syrian military air base.\n",
      "Putin said in an interview with state-run MIR television earlier Wednesday that relations with the US had deteriorated.\n",
      "“The working level of confidence in Russian-American relations, especially at the military level, under the administration of Donald Trump, has not improved, but rather worsened.”\n",
      "A White House memo to the press last week mentioned a meeting between Putin and Tillerson had been scheduled, but the Kremlin appeared to have rolled back on the talks as the Syria rift worsened.\n",
      "Putin has traditionally met with the US Secretary of State on their visits to Moscow. And Tillerson and Putin are no strangers — Putin in 2013 awarded the Order of Friendship to Tillerson when he was CEO of ExxonMobil, the highest honor Russia gives to foreigners.\n",
      "Lavrov gave Tillerson an icy welcome Wednesday, diving straight into Moscow’s grievances with Washington in what would usually be warm opening remarks.\n",
      "Russia “saw some very troubling actions regarding the attack on Syria,” he said, according to an official Russian interpreter.\n",
      "“We believe it is fundamentally important not to let these actions happen again.”\n",
      "The White House on Tuesday accused Russia and Syria of carrying out a confusion campaign over who was responsible for the chemical attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made comparisons between the US response and its 2003 intervention in Iraq, calling it a “tedious” story.\n",
      "The deaths have been widely blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but Russia has denied the regime carried out the attack.\n",
      "Lavrov also complained about the mixed messages coming out of Washington on the Trump administration’s policy on Syria, with the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, making clear Assad should have no future in Syria as Tillerson took a softer line.\n",
      "“I will be frank that we had a lot of questions regarding a lot of very ambiguous as well as contradictory ideas on a whole plethora of bilateral and international agenda coming from Washington,” Lavrov said.\n",
      "He hit back at remarks Tillerson made a day earlier that Russia would have to decide whether it was with the US and the West in standing up against Assad, or against them, describing the comments as “wrong choices.”\n",
      "Tillerson took a more diplomatic tone in his opening remarks, saying that he hoped to clarify “areas of common objectives, areas of common interests, even when our tactical approaches may be different.”\n",
      "“And to further clarify areas of sharp difference, so we can better understand why these differences exist and what the prospects for narrowing those differences may be.”\n",
      "It was a hostile start to the long-awaited meeting, which began with the two men entering a conference room making very little eye contact.\n",
      "The two stood in front of their respective flags beneath a grand chandelier and took their seats on opposite sides of a meters-long table, from which Lavrov delivered his welcome.\n",
      "The fallout over the chemical attack follows comments by the Trump administration and Russia that a reset in relations between the countries was possible after decades of hostility.\n",

      " KARACHI: International media outlets including BBC, Guardian and AFP have predicted that three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will make a comeback as the country’s elected chief executive for the fourth time in the general elections 2024, The News reported Thursday.\n",
      "Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted thrice and came back from self-imposed exile last year, will have an opportunity to clear himself from those allegations due to which he lost his premiership in 2017.\n",
      "Being a prime minister, Nawaz Sharif will have to face volatile supporters of former premier Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated in Adiala jail and has been sentenced to 10 years in jail in cipher case, 14 years in Toshakhna and seven years in an illegal marriage case.\n",
      "According to The Washington Post, it would be surprising if the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo did not emerge victorious in the February 8 polls.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported: “At a gathering of Pakistan’s business elite in Karachi last week, many people interviewed said they predicted a hung parliament and then a weak coalition government. Most expect it to be led by Sharif — or his brother, Shehbaz, also a former prime minister.”\n",
      "“If Nawaz returns as prime minister, he’ll face two challenges. One is managing Pakistan’s economic problems, especially soaring inflation and the other is managing his relationship with a strengthened military,” Bloomberg reported citing Madiha Afzal, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n",
      "CNN reported: “The clear frontrunner in campaigning is Khan’s longtime foe, Nawaz Sharif. The 74-year-old former prime minister is seeking a historic fourth term as leader in what would be a remarkable political comeback following years of self-exile overseas.”\n",
      "“Veteran Sharif will face a strong challenge, however, from first-time candidate for prime minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 35, son of slain former leader Benazir Bhutto,” added CNN.\n",
      "“Sharif is a veteran. He’s always been adept at balancing the United States and China very well. He’ll want good relations with India,” said Tim Willasey-Wilsey, a former senior British diplomat and professor at King’s College London. But the likelihood of a PLM-N victory could see an “an abysmally low” election turnout, analysts said.\n",
      "AP reported, “He has a clear path to a fourth term in office after courts overturned his convictions and prison sentences after his return to the country last October. With his archrival and nemesis Imran Khan now in prison, the stage appears set for a reversal of fortunes from the 2018 election, when Sharif was battling legal cases and Khan became prime minister. With Khan behind bars, analysts predict another victory for Sharif.”\n",
      "US think tank Brookings Institute mentioned: “The prediction is that Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N is likely to win power. The huge surprise, and for PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) it would be a miracle, would be if PTI-affiliated independents can pull off a win.”\n",
      "The US think tank added that PTI had become the largest party and won election in 2018 in an election that had been tilted in favour of Khan and against Nawaz. The tables had turned that time around. So, that was an election which was tilted against Khan and in favour of the PML-N supremo.\n",
      "US think tank, Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Instead, the way has been cleared for Nawaz Sharif, the ultimate survivor of Pakistani politics, to become prime minister and for his party to gain control of parliament with the armed forces supporting them. Sharif is a man who is, shall we say, flexible in his policy views and approach toward the military.”\n",
      "Sputnik reported: “After the elections, the new leader will have to deal with one of the country’s worst economic crises and an escalating terrorism problem. These domestic issues could affect Pakistan’s foreign policy, particularly its relations with its neighbours and international economic partners.”\n",
      "Telegraph wrote: “Former PM appears to expect coronation rather than close fight as his main rival Imran Khan lies buried under criminal convictions. As Nawaz Sharif ends his run for Thursday’s general election, the long-standing giant of Pakistan’s political landscape appears to be going through the motions.”\n",

      "The prime minister, in an interview with a newly launched television channel (Aik News) said the candidates were canvassing and all the rumours would fall to rest by the evening of February 8 – the date for general elections in the country.\n",
      "Regarding the usual complaints of rigging before or after the elections, he said that learning lessons from the past, the parliament needed to address all the flaws regarding the laws, administration, or the Election Commission.\n",
      "He said the observers would monitor and local and international media would report on the activity, assuring that as per the standards in the region, the elections would by and large be free and fair.\n",
      "He observed that the political parties were also involved in the poll rigging by making fake ID cards and casting the votes of deceased persons.\n",
      "He said voting time would be from 9 am to 5 pm on February 8 and everyone should use his constitutional right to vote to ensure a good turnout.\n",
      "Emphasising the key focus on the improvement of the national economy, he said unfortunately no political party had yet come up with an agenda to boost the country’s economic health.\n",
      "He said all the electoral claims made by the parties including jobs, shelters, cheap electricity, food security, and others were directly related to a stable economy.\n",
      "He said the political parties needed to come up with a plan for revenue generation and widen the tax net. Exemplifying a 91% tax-to-GDP ratio in the Scandinavian countries, he said Pakistan’s ratio stood at just 9%, adding that enhanced taxation would also make the government accountable to the masses.\n",
      "Responding to a question about his foreign visits, he recalled that soon after assuming the office, he attended the UN General Assembly session – “a forum which cannot be ignored” and later interactions in Europe where he had a stopover for plane refuelling.\n",
      "He also mentioned attending the BRI Forum in China, the ECO Summit, and the COP28 session where he got the opportunity to interact with world leaders and sign bilateral agreements.\n",
      "He explained that the caretaker government had to play a role to run day-to-day affairs, including foreign policy matters.\n",
      "About the repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, he said Pakistan had expelled only those with no identity and record and that such individuals would be allowed to return after obtaining valid passports and visas. Discussing social media, he called it a challenge that empowered individuals irrespective of their educational and mental capability and advocated for its regulation like the mainstream media.\n",
      "He said the criticism of the caretaker government for doing things beyond the mandate was not genuine as all of its actions were legitimate and vetted by the Law Division besides the backing of cabinet’s approval.\n",

      " Islamabad:the Supreme Court on Friday resumed hearing a set of petitions seeking to determine whether the disqualification period for a lawmaker was for five years or a lifetime.\n",
      "A seven-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, is hearing the case.\n",
      "The proceedings are being broadcast live on the apex court’s website.\n",
      "As the proceedings commenced today, the bench summoned Advocate Makhdoom Ali Khan, the lawyer of Jahangir Khan Tareen, to come to the rostrum.\n",
      "The lawyer stated that the Samiullah Baloch case made a “complete disconnect” between Article 62 and Article 63 of the Constitution, which talk about the disqualification of lawmakers.\n",
      "“It observes that these are two different sets and two different considerations prevail, therefore the language of Article 63 would not be allowed to inform the language of Article 62 of the Constitution,” he contended.\n",
      "Makhdoom maintained that the SC, in the said case, was not talking about a declaration made under the penal laws of the country.\n",
      "At one point, Justice Shah pointed out a benefit that could be drawn from the Samiullah case judgment was that the nature of the declaration was obvious while the duration of the disqualification remains unclear.\n",
      "For his part, Makhdoom said: “[…] I could not find a case for any common law jurisdiction where as a result of civil liability and a decree of a civil court, a citizen is denied the right to exercise, or the protection of a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution for the rest of his life.”\n",
      "He further put forward questions regarding which court was capable of granting a declaration under the civil laws of the country that a person is honest and truthful. “There is no civil court in this country which can grant that,” he contended, adding that judges usually grant declarations on a legal title or legal character.\n",
      "Here, Justice Mandokhail asked if a civil court could issue a declaration of disqualification. The lawyer replied in the negative.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Justice Shah asked: “Can legislation put a timeframe on this declaration? Could that be possible? Could legislation say that this declaration will continue forever, but for the purposes of elections will have a timeframe?”\n",
      "In his response, Makhdoom said Article 62(1)(f) does not say that this is a declaration of the civil court. He added that the Constitution keeps qualification and disqualification separate.\n",
      "“Article 62 applies pre-election, post-election or any time?” Justice Mazhad inquired, to which the lawyer replied Article 63 applied at any time while Article 62 applied only at the time of elections.\n",
      "Here, the CJP interjected that the court had “bummed down in restricting ourselves to reading just a particular provision of the Constitution and we seem to have forgotten the Constitution as a whole”.\n",
      "“What is the Constitution all about? What does it do? What are the fundamental rights?” the top judge asked, lamenting that the constitutional history of Pakistan was being disregarded.\n",
      "“We are disregarding the fact why these amendments were brought into the Constitution, we are disregarding the fact that original Constitution has a greater sanctity than amendments brought unless there are such amendments which enable to serve the people better,” Justice Isa remarked.\n",
      "He recalled that there was “successive encroachment” made into the Constitution throughout history. “Disregard how it came into the Constitution, now you are stuck with the language of the Constitution,” the apex court judge said, stressing that he could not forget the history of Pakistan.\n",
      "“We had given public notice in newspapers but not a single political party came before us that this is a good interpretation of the Constitution,” CJP Isa noted. He highlighted that there must be some logic and reasoning behind lifetime disqualification, saying that a person who “destroyed Pakistan” was allowed to contest elections but others were disqualified for life just for some errors in the nomination papers.\n",
      "“Have we lost all logic and sensibilities?” the chief justice asked. “Will you concede that parliamentarians in Pakistan are the best in the world? Does any other country have this test for parliamentarians? So if we have this test […] that means this is not even a workable law. This is just words on a piece of paper which I can use for my personal projects.”\n",
      "For his part, Makhdoom referred to a US SC judgment where it had rejected new qualifications for lawmakers sought by Congress. Coming to lifetime disqualification, he said: “The Parliament in the 18th Amendment did not mention that the declaration will remain forever.”\n",

      "Addressing a news conference in Lahore on Sunday, she said that Imran Khan faked a drama of cipher after losing power last year, which badly damaged our foreign relations adding that now he was asked pardon from the USA.\n",
      "She said that every single political gimmick of PTI leadership, including allegations of imported government has failed miserably.\n",
      "She said that Imran Khan handed over the country to the IMF and played with the country’s economy.\n",
      "Marriyum Aurangzeb said after the failure of deploying all ‘political gimmicks’, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan was now “playing dirty politics over the dead bodies of poor people to get petty political gains”.\n",
      "She castigated the PTI chief that “how many more lives he would use for gaining political mileage”.\n",
      "The minister said that “Imran Niazi is hellbent on creating anarchy and lawlessness in the county”. She recalled that when the no-confidence motion was tabled against Imran last year, he allegedly concocted the story of cipher and foreign interference without thinking that this would damage Pakistan’s foreign relations.\n",
      "Marriyum said now “Imran Niazi is tendering apologies to the United States and giving clarifications over his self-constructed cipher conspiracy”.\n",
      "She said the PTI chief was not bothered a bit by dragging the country towards anarchy just for his “political vested interest”.\n",
      "She said the former prime minister was using the said tactics to regain power at any cost. For these reasons, the minister said Imran decided to “play with the cipher” and coerced the Speaker, deputy speaker of the National Assembly and even the president to violate the Constitution under his nefarious political agenda.\n",
      "She said behind closed doors, Imran offered life lifetime extension to the former army chief, but when his offer was rejected he started “attacking national institutions”.\n",
      "Marriyum said despite all his efforts, he could not spread anarchy and lawlessness in the country and his alleged desire of the “dismemberment of Pakistan after the fall of his government was not fulfilled”.\n",
      "“From cipher manipulation, he shifted his propaganda to imported government and foreign conspiracy to gain his nefarious designs,” she maintained. She said that every single political gimmick of the PTI leadership, including allegations of imported government, had failed miserably.\n",
      "The minister alleged that “Imran Khan handed over the country to the IMF and played with the country’s economy”.\n",
      "Marriyam Aurangzeb said during the PTI tenure, the practice of horse-trading during the Senate elections was rampant and at the time of no trust vote, an audio leak of Imran surfaced about the purchasing of loyalties of legislators exposing his so-called democratic credentials.\n",
      "“When Imran’s narrative of foreign conspiracy and the imported regime fell flat, he started his long march during which the firing incident occurred and he started the “politics of dead bodies”. She recalled that a television channel reporter Sadaf Naeem ran after Imran’s container in the discharge of professional responsibilities, but she was not allowed to take the interview of Imran. Rather, unfortunately she met an accident and was crushed under the container but the PML-N leadership never accused Imran of her death, the minister upheld.\n",
      "The minister alleged that during the PTI’s rule journalists were arrested, and kidnapped and their ribs were broken, and at the international level, Imran earned the name of a “predator of journalists”.\n",
      "She questioned how many “dead bodies Imran would need for his dirty politics”? The minister said that on Imran’s directions, provincial ministers of KP and Punjab were asked to write letters to sabotage the deal with the IMF. The minister also castigated the PTI chief for plunging the nation into the abyss of inflation and “suspending “the IMF program that he himself had signed and played with the interest of the country.\n",
      "She said that Imran, the other day shared audio of Maryam Nawaz, trying to give it a spin, but to the contrary, the latter never accused Imran or PTI of Zille Shah’s murder, rather she said it was an accident.\n",
      "Marriyum said Imran Khan instead of appearing in the courts to be held accountable for his crimes had plastered his leg.\n",
      "She said that the PTI leadership had used the “mentally challenged person Zille Shah” for its political agenda. She also accused that PTI leader Raja Shakeel’s double cabin vehicle was used for shifting the said deceased body to the hospital, but they escaped from the hospital.\n",
      "She said that in Maryam Nawaz’s audio leak, the PML(N) chief organizer was just expressing regret and sorrow over the attitude of the PTI workers who left the corpse of Zille Shah in the hospital and escaped.\n",
      "She said that even in her speech, Maryam did not accuse Imran as she had no intention to create anarchy in the country.\n",
      "On the contrary, the minister said that Imran wanted to create anarchy and lawlessness in the country as he was not willing to appear in courts and file answers to the cases lodged against him.\n",
      "She said that today, Imran had given the call of a rally[which now has been postponed], lambasting the latter for avoiding the court summons by giving excuses on medical grounds. “He[Imran] has become a senior citizen suffering from diseases which cannot be named publicly,” she quipped.\n",
      "She said that Imran used to ridicule his political opponents for their ailments but he was now giving excuses for his personal ailments. She questioned why did not the PTI leadership inform the police and called an ambulance when they saw that Zille Shah was hit by a vehicle.\n",
      "She asked why the driver of PTI leader Raja Shakeel was given shelter in Zaman Park residence of Imran.\n",
      "She questioned why PTI leader Dr Yasmeen Rashid did not inform the police about the real matter of the incident and why Imran did a tweet even before post-mortem of the deceased. The minister said that a black double cabin of the PTI leader was traced by 31 safe city cameras in Lahore.\n",
      "She said that Raja Shakeel was hiding in Zaman Park and Imran summoned the father of Zille Shah at his residence and “offered him money” to accuse the police, but he said it was an accident.\n",
      "She held that Dr Yasmeen Rashid knew every detail about Zille Shah’s unfortunate death but she did not inform the police who had now traced everything from the CCTV cameras.\n",
      "She said the PTI leadership was trying to use the dead body of its poor worker as “fodder for its nefarious political agenda and now when truth had come out, Imran has announced agitation”.\n",
      "She advised him that instead of creating anarchy and lawlessness, Imran should appear before the courts, and tell the truth about “Toshakhana gifts theft”, “misuse of charity money and his relationship with Tyrian White”.\n",
      "She said that thrice elected PM Nawaz Sharif used to appear in the courts in fake cases to set an example for others. His daughter was handcuffed in front of him, but he never sought exemption from personal appearance. Marriyum said that Imran got the entire PML-N leadership arrested including Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz, Khawaja Asif, Saad Rafiq and Rana Sanaullah.\n",
      "She said that Imran got the “political advantage from the death of PTI worker Zille Shah”. Replying to journalists’ questions, she said Imran Khan was fully aware that he had no answer to the allegations levelled against him. She said Imran who used to accuse political opponents of corruption and money laundering, was himself involved in minting money from the national exchequer.\n",
      "Taking a jibe at Imran, she said he had the “habit of taking money from others’ pockets”, and when he came to power, he “looted the national exchequer mercilessly”. She said that the government did not believe in political victimization otherwise it would have arrested Imran last year when the PDM government came to power.\n",
      "She said Imran was facing cases in the courts for which he should be held accountable. She said the PTI was not a political party, rather it was a “gang of political conspirators”.\n",
      "She said a person who submitted the reply before the courts that he was sick and could not appear personally, was today ready to lead the political rally.\n",
      "To a question, she said that all citizens should be treated equally by the law of the land. She said that Section 144 was imposed for that person who was absconding from the courts on the pretext of health issues but was ready to lead the agitation.\n",
      "“Section 144 was imposed for the person who threatened the courts, who instigated party workers to break the gates of the courts, who is using women and children as a shield to escape arrest,” she held. The minister further said that if such persons were given an exemption then all accused would start behaving like Imran.\n",
      "To a question, she said Shehbaz Sharif had a glorious record as the chief minister of the Punjab and as the prime minister, despite IMF conditions, he had given a marvellous Ramazan package in which the poor would be provided free of charge wheat flour.\n",
      "She said Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister successfully completed the IMF program as the prices of edible items, power and gas tariffs were at record low as compared to Imran Khan’s era. She reiterated once again that Imran signed an agreement with the IMF and he himself “suspended it”.\n",

      "Erdogan, who contests an election in May, said on a visit to the disaster zone that operations were now working normally and promised no one would be left homeless, as the combined reported death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria rose past 12,000.\n",
      "But across a swathe of southern Turkey, people sought temporary shelter and food in freezing winter weather, and waited in anguish by piles of rubble where family and friends may lie buried. Rescuers were still digging out some people alive. Others were found dead.\n",
      "There were similar scenes and complaints in neighbouring Syria, where the impact of Monday’s huge quake extended to.\n",
      "The death toll from both countries was expected to increase as hundreds of collapsed buildings in many cities have become tombs for people who had been asleep in their homes when the quake hit in the early morning.\n",
      "In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens of bodies, some covered in blankets and sheets and others in body bags, were lined up on the ground outside a hospital.\n",
      "Families in southern Turkey and in Syria spent a second night in the freezing cold.\n",
      "Many in the disaster zone had slept in their cars or in the streets under blankets, fearful of going back into buildings shaken by the 7.8 magnitude tremor — Turkey’s deadliest since 1999 — and by a second powerful quake hours later.\n",
      "“Where are the tents, where are food trucks?” said Melek, 64, in Antakya, saying she had not seen any rescue teams. “We survived the earthquake, but we will die here due to hunger or cold here.”\n",
      "The confirmed death toll rose to 9,057 in Turkey on Wednesday, and in Syria had climbed to at least 2,950, according to the government and a rescue service operating in the rebel-held northwest.\n",
      "Turkish authorities released video of rescued survivors, including a young girl in pyjamas, and an older man covered in dust, an unlit cigarette clamped between his fingers as he was pulled from the debris.\n",
      "In Syria’s Aleppo, staff at the Al-Razi hospital attended to a man with bruised eyes who said more than a dozen relatives including his father and mother were killed when the building they were in collapsed.\n",

The wife and two kids of my brother who got out with me also died.”TVErdogan, who has declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces and sent in troops to help, arrived in Kahramanmaras to view the damage and see the rescue and relief effort.\n",
      "Speaking to reporters, with the wail of ambulance sirens in the background, Erdogan said there had been problems with roads and airports but “we are better today”.\n",

On the other hand, analysts say, he could rally national support around the crisis response and strengthen his position.The quake toppled thousands of buildings including hospitals, schools and apartment blocks, injured tens of thousands, and left countless people homeless.\n",

State news agency SANA quoted Hussein Makhlouf, minister of local administration and environment, as saying the state had opened 180 shelters for displaced people.\n",
      "In Jandaris in northern Syria, rescue workers and residents said dozens of buildings had collapsed.\n",
      "Standing around the wreckage of what had been a 32-apartment building, relatives of people who had lived there said they had seen no one removed alive. A lack of heavy equipment to lift large concrete slabs was impeding rescue efforts.\n",
      "Rescue workers have struggled to reach some of the worst-hit areas, held back by destroyed roads, poor weather and a lack of heavy equipment. Some areas are without fuel and electricity.\n",
      "A rescue service operating in insurgent-held northwest Syria said the number of dead had climbed to more than 1,280 and more than 2,600 were injured. The Syrian health minister said the number of dead in government-held areas rose to 1,250.\n",
      "Across the street from an Aleppo apartment building reduced to rubble, 25-year-old Youssef has waited for two days for news of his father, mother, brother, sister and her son.\n",
      "He said he had heard their voices, and spoken to them, but poorly equipped rescue workers had not been able to reach them.\n",
      "“I talked to them and heard their voice, but unfortunately as you can see here they’re very slow at work and they don’t have enough equipment,” he said.\n",

      "The minister said the Daily Mail’s apology to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was actually an apology to the 220 million people of Pakistan. Imran Khan, in animosity of Shehbaz Sharif, used David Rose to publish a baseless news story against the PM, she added.\n",
      "She said that in 2016 when Nawaz Sharif was holding office, Pakistan’s GDP growth rate was 6.2 percent whereas inflation was only 2.3 percent. During Nawaz’s era, she added, the IMF programme was rolled back, CPEC projects were started, employment opportunities were provided to the youth, and 14,000 megawatts of electricity were added to the national grid.\n",

On the contrary, he himself was caught doing money laundering. Marriyum Aurangzeb asked when will Imran Khan give an account of his theft?\n",
      "Imran Khan made the country’s treasury a “retail shop” during his time, whereas Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was striving for the betterment of the people.\n",
      "She congratulated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal for emerging victorious in the court cases.\n",
      "She said Hanif Abbasi was sentenced to 25-years imprisonment in Imran’s tenure but he stood firm and even now standing firm like a lion. Imran took false oaths and put a heroin case on Rana Sanaullah, who stood strong like a rock and still standing like a lion with Nawaz Sharif.\n",
      "She said Imran embezzled the BRT money and abused the Chief Election Commissioner when it decided the case against him on merit.\n",
      "He used to offer an extension to the army chief in closed rooms but campaigned against the martyrs outside.\n",
      "Imran Khan, she said, appointed an incompetent and inefficient person as the chief minister of Punjab who damaged the province.\n",
      "Taking a jibe at the PTI chairman, she said, after 4 years in power, Imran claimed that he had no power, whereas he had Farah Gogi and Pinki with him. She said Imran Khan even sold a gifted watch carrying the image of the Holy Kaaba.\n",
      "She said, in Imran Khan’s era, Nawaz Sharif used to come to courts along with his daughter and presented documents from the past 40 years in accountability courts to clear his name.\n",
      "She said when Imran Khan was asked to answer for his wrongdoings, he got worried and appeared in public on the wheelchair.\n",

      " ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Wednesday said that the former prime minister must face a transparent probe for selling the Toshakhana gift of an expensive wrist watch gifted by the royal highness of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Addressing a live media talk here, the Defence Minister said his news conference intended to narrate the facts before the nation to provide the background for the recent scandal of Imran Khan.\n",
      "Khawaja said Imran Khan did huge mudslinging and vandalization of his political rivals during his tenure. He added that a letter pertaining to £190 million was presented in Khan’s cabinet that he secretly gave to Malik Riaz’s Bahria Foundation. “This is not new as Imran Khan’s dishonesty continued to reveal after his ouster from power. He orchestrated hoax narrative of foreign conspiracy and backed out from his own statements.”\n",
      "The way Khan perpetrated false narrative and sold the precious gifts received from the dignitaries of a friendly country had damaged the honour and integrity of the county, he added.\n",
      "“We are not in a sound state internally due to our weak economy and owing to which it has reflection on our external relations as well”, he added.\n",
      "The Defence Minister alleged that Imran Khan wanted Pakistan to go default and targeted army and its top official for satiating his personal whims. On one hand, he said Khan was following his so-called style of intimidation and on the other he was pleading behind the doors to the Army Chief for his help during his meeting arranged by the President.\n",
      "He accused that Khan had done financial misappropriation and was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan which was all matter of record.\n",
      "He pointed out that previous day scandal of selling toshakhana watches had two important things as the dates were manipulated on which the wrist watches were sold in the market. The law was also manipulated to buy the toshakhana gifts on 20% value.\n",
      "The gift was given by the friendly country’s Crown prince that had a unique prestige, he said, adding, “The dates of money deposited in the record have separate dates which should be probed.”\n",
      "The Defence Minister underscored that the individuals involved in the sale of the gifts should be present in Pakistan and should record their statements during the investigation.\n",
      "“Imran Khan himself has been disqualified from ECP and he put the burden of resentment on the nation by hurling hoax propaganda.”\n",
      "Nawaz Sharif was lifetime disqualified for not declaring Rs10,000 and his daughter was also penalized whereas Imran Khan had crossed all ethical limits, he said.\n",
      "The government, he said was now demanding to hold Imran Khan accountable as per the law that disqualified Nawaz Sharif for hiding Rs10,000.\n",
      "“We have come to a turn where a clean judicial process not the one that indicted Maryam Nawaz and Nawaz Sharif rather a fare and impartial system should hold Imran Khan accountable.”\n",
      "The channels of money received by Imran Khan should be probed as Khan was presenting a dubious record of his Ferozewala land having changing status from benamedar to self-owned or inherited property to confirm his income sources, he added.\n",
      "“There is rule of law in Pakistan now whereas in Imran Khan’s three years rule several political leaders were detained including Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Shehbaz Sharif, Shahid Khaqqan Abbasi, Asif Ali Zardari and his sister among others.”\n",
      "He added that there was a reign of terror during his tenure as anyone could be detained through National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\n",

      " Tokyo: Former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving leader, died on Friday after being shot while campaigning for a parliamentary election, an official from his political party said.\n",
      "A man opened fire on Abe, 67, from behind with an apparently homemade gun as he spoke at a drab traffic island in the western city of Nara, Japanese media showed earlier.\n",
      "It was the first assassination of a sitting or former Japanese premier since the days of prewar militarism in the 1930s.\n",
      "Speaking before Abe’s death was announced, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the shooting in the “strongest terms” while Japanese people and world leaders expressed shock at the violence in a country in which political violence is rare and guns are tightly controlled.\n",
      "“This attack is an act of brutality that happened during the elections — the very foundation of our democracy — and is absolutely unforgivable,” said Kishida, struggling to keep his emotions in check.\n",
      "A fire department official had said Abe appeared to be in a state of cardiac arrest when airlifted to hospital.\n",
      "Police said a 41-year-old man suspected of carrying out the shooting had been arrested. NHK quoted the suspect, identified as Tetsuya Yamagami, as telling police he was dissatisfied with Abe and wanted to kill him.\n",
      "Abe was making a campaign speech outside a train station when two shots rang out at about 11:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). Security officials were then seen tackling a man in a grey T-shirt and beige trousers.\n",

      "The United States is Japan’s most important ally.\n",
      "Abe is best known for his “Abenomics” policy of aggressive monetary easing and fiscal spending.\n",
      "He also bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military’s ability to project power abroad.\n",
      "Abe, however, did not achieve his goal of revising the US-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan’s military in known, into the pacifist Article 9.\n",
      "Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.\n",

      " LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will seek to shore up his position on Tuesday by setting out a raft of new policies to senior ministers after he survived a confidence vote that revealed the scale of the threat to his position.\n",
      "Johnson won the vote late on Monday by 211 votes to 148 — enough to avoid having to immediately resign but a larger than anticipated rebellion within his party that leaves him politically wounded and battling to win back the confidence of his colleagues and the general public.\n",
      "His first challenge will be to convince his most senior allies, some of whom would have likely run to replace him if he had been forced out, that he will be able to move on from questions about his leadership.\n",
      "Johnson’s office issued a statement saying he would use the meeting to set out his vision for the coming weeks, including new policies to reduce the cost of childcare and to help more people buy their own homes.\n",
      "“This is a government that delivers on what the people of this country care about most,” Johnson said in the statement.\n",
      "“We are on the side of hard-working British people, and we are going to get on with the job.”\n",
      "Lawmakers in Johnson’s party called the confidence vote after months of scandal over lockdown-breaking parties at the heart of government and criticism of his response to an inflation-fuelled surge in the cost of living.\n",
      "The front pages of British newspapers offered little comfort that the vote was, as Johnson described it in the aftermath on Monday, a decisive result that allows him to refocus on his political priorities.\n",
      "The Daily Telegraph called the result a “hollow victory. The Sun tabloid declared “PM survives … Just”\n",
      "Calling the result a “pyrrhic victory”, the Times leader column said the narrow win left Johnson’s political authority badly dented and his party even more divided.\n",
      "“If Mr Johnson is to avoid leading the Tories (Conservatives) to a calamitous defeat in the next election, he will need to show a degree of grip and focus that has been largely absent so far in his premiership … ,” it said.\n",
      "The rules of Johnson’s Conservative Party mean he is safe from another confidence vote for the next 12 months, but those rules could technically be changed if there is enough political will to do so.\n",

      "The court also directed the respondents to submit their replies within seven days and adjourned the hearing for November 26. The others include The News editor-in-chief and the newspaper’s editor.\n",
      "Shamim was not present for today’s proceedings presided over by IHC CJ. During the hearing, Shamim’s son told the court that the ex-judge had reached Islamabad the night before and was felling unwell. He also asked permission to play a video in the court and to bring a laptop into the courtroom. However, the request was denied.\n",
      "At the outset of the hearing, the IHC CJ said that it was necessary to restore people’s faith in the judiciary.\n",
      "Addressing Editior In Chief , Justice Minallah said that a former judge was issued a notice by the court due to a story carried in the newspaper he publishes.\n",
      "The IHC CJ said that he had full confidence in his judges. “This case would not exist if I did not have confidence in them. Every judge in this court has maintained the public’s faith.”\n",
      "He said that judges were also accountable and noted that it was a citizen’s right to criticise them.\n",
      "He also questioned whether a newspaper’s editorial policy allowed it to publish a story on its front page which cited an affidavit that was filed in London, and directed the senior journalist to read the headline of the story out loud.\n",
      "The story in question was titled “Ex-CJ GB claims in signed affidavit: ‘Saqib Nisar directed not to release Nawaz, Maryam before 2018 elections'”.\n",
      "“This affidavit is not a part of any court record. Where was this notarised?” Justice Minallah asked, adding that this concerned the credibility of the higher courts.\n",
      "Meanwhile, coming down hard on the senior journalist, the IHC CJ questioned whether he had checked the date of the court’s order against Maryam and Nawaz. “You are an expert at investigating, did you investigate yourself?”\n",
      "He also asked the senior journalist whether he had checked who was part of the bench hearing the cases against the PML-N leaders, adding that he and Justice Aamer Farooq were abroad when the appeal was filed and the case was fixed for hearing.\n",
      "“Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Miangul Hassan were present in the country at the time. Did you inquire about this from the high court registrar?”\n",
      "He observed that noted lawyers were part of the case against the PML-N leaders. “Did you ask them if they had requested for a date before the general elections?”\n",
      "He said that Khawaja Haris was the petitioner at the time. “Did you check with him about the bench hearing the case?”\n",
      "He remarked that “scandals” were being perpetuated to ruin people’s trust in the country’s institutions.\n",
      "“If another judge spoke like this in front of me I would get in touch with the Supreme Judicial Council,” he said.\n",
      "“A person witnesses the CJP asking someone to commit a crime. The person stays silent for three years and an affidavit concerning the incident surfaces. How can a newspaper publish such a document?” he asked.\n",
      "When the senior journalist requested for permission to speak in court, the IHC CJ replied “you have already caused enough damage”.\n",
      "“I was the one who gave the story, you can take action against me,” the senior journalist said, adding that he had done so in an effort to protect the sanctity of the court.\n",
      "“A former GB judge is levelling an allegation against a former CJP. Take action against me but also carry out an investigation,” senior journalist said.\n",
      "During the hearing, Shamim’s lawyer also asked the IHC CJ whether the court would take notice of the statements made by Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda. According to news reports, the minister had stated that the former judge should be hanged and flogged in public for levelling the allegations against Nisar.\n",
      "However, the court refused to include it in the case and told Shamim’s lawyer to file a separate appeal.\n",
      "A day earlier, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah, under the Contempt of Court Ordinance, took notice of the report, which claimed that in 2018 Nisar influenced judicial proceedings to prolong the detention of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz following their conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference.

      "Several websites have also published reports based on this claim.\n",
      "AFWA probeThe interview in question has been carried by several news websites. Had Luc given such a shocking statement, it would have surely been carried by international media. But we did not find any such statement attributed to Luc in any credible media outlet.\n",

      "A clip of Luc’s interview is being circulated on social media in which he’s seen questioning the idea of vaccinating people during the pandemic.\n",
      "“It’s unthinkable to vaccinate during a pandemic. They’re silent. It is the antibodies produced by the virus that enable the infection to become stronger. It is what we call antibody-dependent enhancement, which means antibodies favour a certain infection.

      "The Nobel laureate has called mass vaccination against coronavirus during the pandemic “unthinkable” and a historic blunder that is “creating the variants” and leading to deaths from the disease. He has also raised concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).\n",
      "According to the Mary Ann Liebert “Coronavirus Resource Center,” virus-specific antibodies are in general considered antiviral and play an important role in controlling infections in a number of ways.\n",
      "However, in some instances, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This activity is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

      "Luc’s history of controversial statementsLuc Montagnier was the joint recipient (along with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Harald Zur Hausen) of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, his nomination had led to massive controversy as there were allegations of theft and deception against him.\n",
      "Thereafter, Luc created several controversies with his statements.\n",
      "Last year, he’d said that the deadly coronavirus was manufactured in a laboratory in China’s Wuhan. Though this theory is yet to receive validation, it had created quite a sensation back then.\n",
      "As per the French news website “The Connexion”, just one year after winning the Nobel prize, he had claimed that a good immune system was enough to protect people against AIDS. The report also says that Luc is known for being anti-vaccination, pro-homoeopathy, and believes that “water has memory”.\n",
      "In 2017, he had opposed the French government’s decision to make certain vaccinations mandatory, accusing the policy of “poisoning the next generation little by little”. In response, 106 academicians and scientists had written an open letter, alleging that one of their peers is using his Nobel Prize status to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge.\n",
      "Thus, it is clear that though Luc Montagnier has indeed raised concerns around vaccination during the Covid-19 pandemic, but he has not said anything like people who vaccinate themselves will die within two years.\n",

He said the government successfully overcome this challenge and faded all the hopes of the opposition to trample the new dispensation. He said it is regrettable that the opposition opposed the Financial Action Task Force related legislation to prevent Pakistan from falling into FATF’s black list and to bring the country out of its grey list. He said yesterday’s speeches by the opposition leaders were celebrated in India.\n",

We are hopeful that by the completion of this project, we will be able to make a substantial contribution towards combating the circulation of false and unverified information on the internet.”\n",

      " KABUL: The Afghan government has released 100 Taliban prisoners, a government official said, a day after the armed group said it was walking out of talks with Kabul.\n",
      "Javid Faisal, spokesman for Afghanistan’s Office of the National Security Council, said: “The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan released 100 Taliban prisoners today based on their health condition, age and length of remaining sentence, as part of our efforts for peace.”\n",
      "The Taliban had accused the Afghan government of delaying the prisoner swap that was part of an agreement signed with the United States in the Qatari capital, Doha.\n",
      "The two foes have been negotiating since last week to try to finalise the prisoner swap that was originally supposed to have happened by March 10 and pave the way for “intra-Afghan” peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.\n",
      "But the swap has been beset with problems, with Kabul claiming the Taliban wants 15 “top commanders” to be released, while the armed group has accused Afghan authorities of needlessly wasting time.\n",
      "The US signed the deal with the Taliban on February 29 that required the Afghan government – which was not a signatory to the agreement – to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners, and for the armed group to release 1,000 pro-government captives in return.\n",
      "As per the terms of the deal, Washington promised to withdraw US and foreign troops from Afghanistan by July next year, in return for security guarantees from the Taliban.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, said the group recalled its negotiators from Kabul, hours after it suspended talks on the prisoner exchange with the Afghan government.\n",
      "“The intentional delays in the release of our prisoners violates the peace agreement, therefore we call back our technical team back from Kabul,” Shaheen said in a tweet.\n",
      "Despite the setback over the prisoner releases, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said progress had been made since he visited Kabul on March 23 to press Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud over the results of a disputed September election.\n",
      "“We’ve made some progress, but we see them posturing in the media, we see statements that come out,” he told a State Department news conference.\n",
      "While the feud has persisted, Pompeo’s visit and his announcement of a $1bn cut in US aid to Afghanistan appeared to have an impact, with Ghani on March 26 announcing a delegation for peace talks with the Taliban that won Abdullah’s endorsement.\n",

      " CARACAS:  Anti-government demonstrators clashed with troops loyal to Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro at an air base in the capital hours after opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets in a bold and risky attempt to lead a military uprising against the embattled socialist.\n",
      "The early-morning rebellion seems to have only limited military support.\n",
      "But it was by far the most-serious challenge yet to Maduro’s rule since Guaidó, with the backing of the U.S. and dozens of other countries, declared himself the country’s interim president in January in rejection of a government he accused of stealing last year’s presidential election.\n",
      "The dramatic events began early Tuesday when Guaidó, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armored crowd control vehicles, released a three-minute video filmed near a Caracas air base in which he called on civilians and others in the armed forces to join a final push to topple Maduro.\n",
      "In a surprise, standing alongside him was Leopoldo Lopez, his political mentor and the nation’s most-prominent opposition activist, who has largely been silent and unseen since he was detained in 2014 for leading a previous round of anti-government unrest. Lopez said he had been released from house arrest by security forces adhering to order from Guaidó.\n",
      "“I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers,” Lopez declared.\n",
      "As the two opposition leaders coordinated actions from vehicles parked on a highway overpass, troops loyal to Maduro sporadically fired tear gas from inside the adjacent Carlota air base.\n",
      "The events, playing out in the opposition’s stronghold in a wealthier neighborhood of eastern Caracas, appeared not to have triggered a broader military revolt.\n",
      "Flanked by top military commanders, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López appeared on national television and condemned Guaido’s move as a “terrorist” act that was bound to fail.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the “right-wing extremists” would not succeed in fracturing the armed forces, which have largely stood with the socialist leader throughout the months of turmoil.\n",
      "“Since 2002, we’ve seen the same pattern,” he a news agency adding that most of Caracas was calm. “They call for violence, a coup, and send people into the streets so that there are confrontations and deaths. And then from the blood they try to construct a narrative,”\n",
      "Hundreds of government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered at the presidential palace, answering the call by socialist leaders to come to the embattled Maduro’s rescue.\n",
      "Guaidó said the troops who had taken to the streets were protecting Venezuela’s constitution and that in the coming hours he would release a list of top commanders supporting the uprising.\n",
      "Anti-government demonstrators gathered in several other cities, although there were no reports that Guaidó’s supporters had taken control of any military installations.\n",
      "“The armed forces have taken the right decision,” said Guaidó. “With the support of the Venezuelan people and the backing of our constitution, they are on the right side of history.”\n",
      "As events unfolded, governments from around the world expressed a mix of support for Guaidó while reiterating calls to avoid violent confrontation.\n",
      "U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, in a Twitter post directed at defense minister Padrino, said the armed forces “must protect the Constitution and the Venezuelan people.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, Spain’s caretaker government urged restraint, while the governments of Cuba and Bolivia reiterated their support for Maduro.\n",

      "The so-called “quick counts” from reputable survey organizations that use a sample of polling stations have been reliable in past elections.\n",

      "Some voters went to their local mosque before casting ballots, as the daily call to prayer sounded across a nation that is nearly 90 percent Muslim.\n",
      "Opinion polls show Widodo, 57, is a clear favorite – but he faces a tough challenge from Subianto, 67, who has leaned on a fiery nationalist ticket and warned he will challenge the results over voter-list irregularities if he loses.\n",
      "Subianto narrowly lost to Widodo in 2014 elections, and unsuccessfully challenged those results.\n",
      "Voters will flock to more than 800,000 polling stations where they’ll punch holes in ballots – to make clear their candidate choice – and then dip a finger in ink, a measure to prevent double-voting in a graft-riddled country where ballot buying is rife.\n",
      "The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800 kilometers across more than 17,000 islands with a population of more than 260 million, including hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.\n",
      "Officials are moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and – as well as elephants and horses – to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.\n",
      "The poll has been punctuated by bitter mudslinging and a slew of fake news online that threatens to sway millions of undecided voters.\n",
      "Widodo has campaigned on his ambitious drive to build much-needed roads, airports and other infrastructure across Southeast Asia’s largest economy.\n",
      "Raised in a bamboo shack in a riverside slum, the soft-spoken Widodo stands in stark contrast to Subianto, whose strongman image is underscored by a penchant for slamming lecterns as he accuses Jakarta of selling the country off to foreign interests.\n",
      "Subianto – joined by running mate Sandiaga Uno, a 49-year-old wealthy financier -takes a page from US President Donald Trump, vowed to put “Indonesia first” by reviewing billions of dollars in Chinese investment.\n",
      "Subianto’s long-held presidential ambitions have been dogged by strong ties to the Suharto family and a chequered past.\n",

      " ISLAMABAD: Defense ministry has filed a review petition against Supreme Court verdict on the Faizabad sit-in case viewing that the highest court decision negatively affected courage of armed forces.\n",
      "It is viewed in the review petition that the judicial verdict raised an impression that Pakistan armed forces were violating their oath while it was stated without any solid proof.\n",
      "The petition categorically said that armed forces chief directed to take departmental action against unknown persons in the light of the court verdict while Intelligence Bureau, Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI), police and defense ministry submitted several responses into the court regarding the Faizabad verdict.\n",
      "“Allegations on the armed forces and ISI in the court verdict are totally baseless while the orders given to armed forces are also vague and unclear as the verdict did not provide any evidence and proof of any person of armed forces involvement in the sit-in,” it argued.\n",
      "The petition insisted that observation given against the armed forces and the ISI be clipped from the SC judgment while the SC observation was solely based on newspapers and assumptions.\n",
      "The SC verdict also gives an impression that the armed forces also involved in banning media and the general elections held in 2018 while armed forces were called for security arrangements for ensuring free and fair elections. During the general elections, military personnel had to report to wrongdoings to the presiding officer and duty officer of armed forces had authority to take immediate action and DG Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) gave his statement in this regard. Armed forces provided their services for the protective environment and overseeing wrongdoings in the general elections held in 2018.\n",
      "It was also argued that enemies and foreign forces have been accusing Pakistan army of facilitating extremists in the region and, therefore, the court verdict as a whole benefitting false narrative regarding army assisting extremists adding that if the SC judgment is not reviewed then India will get the opportunity for false propaganda against Pakistan.\n",
      "The petition also mentioned that the Faizabad sit-in and Asghar Khan case have major difference while no evidence and proofs were provided regarding any person belonging to armed forces involvement in the Faizabad sit-in and for other allegations.\n",
      "It was also stated in the review petition that no notices served to armed forces before announcing the judgment.\n",

      "Every citizen has right to create political parties, gathering and protests including political activists. According to verdict, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was registered as political party while any political party was restricted to propagate against constitution and political parties cannot be involved in terrorism under Election Act.\n",
      "“The maintenance of public order is the paramount duty of the State. If anyone propagates, “hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Federal or Provincial Government”55 they commit the offence of sedition for which the punishment is imprisonment for life.”\n",

      "“Every citizen not being in the service of Pakistan shall have the right to form or be a member of a political party”63, however, as this fundamental right itself stipulates, it is one which vests in every citizen of Pakistan.

      " Washington: Quitting Facebook makes people happier, less engaged with news, and more likely to spend time with friends and family, according to a study.\n",
      "Researchers at Stanford University and New York University also found that once people quit Facebook temporarily, they spend less time online overall, ditching other websites for real-world interactions too.\n",
      "A new study titled ‘The Welfare Effects of Social Media’ asked almost 3,000 moderate Facebook users to log out for a month to see what happened.\n",
      "The findings are released just as Facebook marks its 15th birthday, having expanded from a dormitory room hobby project to a network of websites and apps with more than 2.7bn users every month.\n",
      "The study took place last November, coinciding with the 2018 US midterm elections, and offered 2,844 people $100 to log off for a month.\n",
      "Those who logged off Facebook for a month found themselves with a lot more free time on their hands: Deactivating Facebook freed up 60 minutes per day for the average person in the study.\n",
      "However, the research team was surprised to find that, rather than logging on to other websites, people were actually more inclined to switch off entirely from their digital connections and spend more time watching TV, socialising with friends and family, or exercising.\n",
      "Participants also found that they were much happier after they logged out of their Facebook accounts. This is consistent with findings in other studies.\n",
      "“Deactivation caused small but significant improvements in well-being, and in particular on self- reported happiness, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety,” they wrote.\n",
      "Another of key outcome of the study is that participants consumed less news when they weren’t using Facebook.\n",
      "News knowledge and attention to politics declined and participants were “less able to correctly answer factual questions about recent news events”.\n",
      "There was no detectable effect on political engagement but deactivation “significantly reduced polarisation of views on policy issues”.\n",
      "The final point of the study was to look at whether logging off Facebook for a month had any long-term impact on whether people were likely to start using the platform again once the study had ended.\n",
      "Several weeks after the study ended, those who had deactivated Facebook were using the app 12 minutes less than those in the control group, who had kept using the app during the study.\n",
      "Five percent of those who had deactivated their accounts had not reactivated them nine weeks after the experiment ended.\n",

      " Islamabad (December 29, 2018): Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has requested the Supreme Court to close the Asghar Khan case related to the alleged distribution of money among politicians, including former premier Nawaz Sharif, to defeat the PPP in the 1990 general elections.\n",
      "According to sources, FIA submitted a report to the top court today, stating that it has no evidence enough to initiate proceedings against those named in the case.\n",
      "The politicians who were accused of receiving money denied doing so in their statements, it added.The report said there were gaps and contradiction in the statements of witnesses in the 25-year-old matter. Besides, there was no record of transactions made through banks, it added.\n",
      "In his reply, PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had earlier categorically stated that he never received Rs3.5 million from the former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for the campaign in 1990 elections.He denied that he had received Rs3.5 million or Rs2.5 million from ISI director general Lt Gen Asad Durrani or the then owner of now defunct Mehran Bank Younis Habib.\n",
      "Mr. Sharif stated that he had already recorded his statement in this case on Oct 14, 2015.\n",
      "Nonetheless, Supreme Court fixed December 31st as the date of hearing for the Asghar Khan case.A three-member bench of the apex court comprising Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, Justice Faisal Arab and Justice Munib Akhtar will take up the case.\n",
      "At the previous hearing, the court had directed the Attorney General for Pakistan and the Director-General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to provide details of the progress made to implement the landmark court verdict in the Asghar Khan case.\n",
      "Justice Saqib had noted that the court will fix the responsibility on those who did not implement the verdict, despite a lapse of many years.The court had also rejected the petitions filed by former army chief Gen (retd) Mirza Aslam Beg and DG ISI Lt-Gen (Retd) Asad Durrani to review the short verdict passed by the top court on October 19, 2012 on a petition of Air Marshal (retd) Asghar Khan, who died on January 5, 2018.\n",
      "In the short order, the apex court had directed the federal government to initiate action against the Gen Beg and Gen Durrani for their role in dishing out Rs140 million to the group of politicians.\n",
      "In its November 8, 2012 detailed judgment, the Supreme Court had ordered the FIA to initiate proceedings against the politicians, including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had allegedly been given a total of Rs140 million with the objective of blocking chances of the Pakistan Peoples Party’s victory in the 1990 general election.\n",
      "The 140-page detailed judgment, authored by the then CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, had emphasized that all officers who obeyed unlawful commands were individually liable and in the event of failure of the state authorities to take action, the rights of the people of Pakistan were to be upheld by the Supreme Court.The verdict had conceded that the 1990 general election was polluted by doling out Rs140 million to a particular group of politicians only to deprive the people of the chance of being represented by their chosen representatives.\n",
      "It also held that the President of Pakistan, Chief of the Army Staff, ISI DG or their subordinates certainly were not supposed to create an ‘Election Cell’ or to support a political party/group of political parties, because if they did so, the citizens would fail to elect their representatives in an honest, fair and free process of election, and their actions would negate the constitutional mandate on the subject.\n",
      "According to the judgment, an election cell was established in the presidency to influence the general election of 1990. Then army chief Gen Beg and then ISI DG Lt-Gen Durrani participated in the unlawful activities of the election cell in violation of the responsibilities of the army and ISI as institutions, which was an act of individuals, but not of the institution they represented.The judgment also said that the ISI or MI may perform their duties as per laws to safeguard the borders of Pakistan or to provide civil aid to the federal government, but such organizations have no role to play in political activities or politics, for formulation or destabilization of political governments, nor can they facilitate or show favour to a political party or group of political parties or politicians individually, in any manner, which may lead in his or their success.\n",
      "In 1996, retired Air Marshal Asghar Khan wrote a letter to the then CJP Nasim Hassan Shah alleging that the then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, then army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg, then director general ISI Lt Gen Asad Durrani and then head of Habib Bank Sindh and owner of now defunct Mehran Bank, Younis Habib had doled out Rs140 million among several politicians ahead of 1990 polls to ensure Benazir Bhutto’s defeat in the general elections.\n",

      "Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25 December 1876 in Karachi.At home, his family talked in Gujarati language, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English.Except for Fatima Ali jinnah, little is known of his siblings. His father’s name was Jinnah Poonja (1857- 1901) and his mother’s name was Mithibai. Jinnah was the eldest of the seven children of Jinnah Poonja and Mithibai. His family had migrated to Sindh from the Kathiawar area of Gujarat, India In 1891(when he was fifteen), Jinnah went to London and worked for few years for a company. Before going to London, he was married to Emibai.She was his distant relative. At the time of her marriage, Emibai was around 14 or 16 years old. But, Emibai died shortly after Jinnah had gone to London. At around the same time, his mother also died.In 1894, Jinnah quit his job to study law. He joined the course at Lincoln’s Inn and graduated in 1896. While still in London, he also started to participate in politics. He greatly admired Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Gradually Jinnah was developing his own political outlook. He was thinking on the line that India should have a constitutional self-government.Around this time, his father lost his business. This put Jinnah under great difficulty. In the meantime, he had started to practice as a lawyer in Mumbai. He also built a house in Mumbai’s Malabar Hill area. The house is now known as Jinnah House.He became a successful lawyer. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a famous leader of India, once used Jinnah to work as a lawyer. Tilak was facing charges of sedition against the British Raj.On 25 January 1910, Jinnah became a member on the sixty-member Imperial Legislative Council. He was an active member of the Council. Like many other leaders of India At the beginning Jinnah had avoided joining the All India Muslim League, another political organization of India. Muslims had formed the League in 1906. In 1913, Jinnah became a member of the Muslim League. In 1916, he became the president of the Muslim League. He helped in making an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League(Lucknow Pact in 1916).\n",
      "In 1918, Jinnah married again. His second wife was Rattanbai Petit. She was twenty-four years younger than him. She was the daughter of Jinnah’s personal friend Sir Dinshaw Petit The Jinnah couple resided in Bombay (now Mumbai) and frequently travelled to Europe. In 1919, his wife bore a daughter who was named Dina.Many Muslim leaders of India like Aga Khan III, Coudhary Rahmat Ali and Sir Muhammad Iqbal requested Jinnah to come back to India.The leaders of the Muslim League wanted him to take charge of the Muslim League. Jinnah agreed to come back to India. In 1934, he left London and returned to India to reorganize the Muslim league again. But he could not revive the stature of the party until after the elections of 1937 as the Muslim League won only a few seats. However, at this time, the League was helped by the powerful Premier of the Punjab, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan. On October 1937, he agreed with Jinnah’s Muslim League joining his strong government. This was called the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact.His differences with the Congress Party continued to become bigger. In 1930, some Muslim leaders like Allama Iqbal had argued for a separate country for the Muslim people of India. At last he came to the conclusion that Hindus and Muslims cannot live in a single country.Jinnah also started to have the idea of a separate country for Muslims of India. Jinnah and the Muslim League started work to get such a separate country. They made a plan for this in 1940 called the Pakistan Resolution. This new country was to be named Pakistan.In 1941, Jinnah founded a newspaper, named the Dawn. This newspaper published the views and political thinking of the Muslim League.After the Second World War, Great Britain started steps to give independence to India. On 16 May 1946, the British announced plan for a united India. One month after, on 16 June 1946, the British announced another plan to partition the British Raj into two countries, one for the Hindus and one for the Muslims.The Congress Party accepted the plan of the 16 May 1946. The Muslim League under Jinnah’s leadership accepted both the plans. But, on 16 August 1946, Jinnah also announced the Direct Action to achieve independence for Pakistan, a separate country of Muslims of the former British Raj. After several rounds of discussion, the British Raj was partitioned (in August 1947) into two countries, India and Pakistan. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan.The British Raj of India was partitioned into two countries, namely, India and Pakistan. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan, his sister Fatimah Jinnah became the “Mother of the Nation”. He also became the president of Pakistan’s constituent assembly. In an address to the constituent assembly on 11 August 1947, Jinnah told about the future of Pakistan as a secular state. He told this in the following words:You may belong to any religion caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the state. In due course of time, Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state\n",
      "Jinnah had been suffering from tuberculosis since the early 1940s. Only his sister, and very few other persons close to the family knew this. After partition of India and creation of Pakistan, he had become the governor general of Pakistan. His work was increased, but his health was deteriorating. To regain his health, he spent many months at his official rest house. The rest house was located at a place named in Ziarat. Jinnah could not regain his health. He died on 11 September 1948 from tuberculosis and lung cancer.At the place of his funeral, the government of Pakistan has constructed a big mausoleum. His house named Jinnah House is under the possession of the government of India. The government of India wants to give the house to the government of Pakistan. But, the position is not clear till now.\n",

      " Sydney (December 15, 2018): Australia formally recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of Middle East policy, but will not move its embassy there immediately, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday.\n",
      "“Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,” Morrison said.\n",
      "“We look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem when practical,” he told reporters in Sydney.\n",
      "Morrison said in October he was open to shifting Australia’s embassy from Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in May delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies.Morrison’s unexpected announcement in October was viewed cynically because it came days before a crucial by-election in an electorate with a strong Jewish representation, a poll his party subsequently lost.\n",
      "It also drew criticism from Muslim-majority neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia, neither of whom formally recognize Israel’s right to exist. Arab countries worried that the move would unnecessarily inflame tensions in the Middle East.\n",
      "Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 Middle East war, and wants all embassies based there. The international community believes Jerusalem’s status should be resolved through negotiation.\n",
      "The status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians who want East Jerusalem recognized as the capital of a Palestinian state.\n",
      "Morrison said Australia would not move its embassy to West Jerusalem until the city’s final status was determined, but said trade and defense offices would be opened there.\n",
      "He confirmed Australia’s support for a two-state solution with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.\n",
      "“What we are saying is we’ve got to move this forward. The rancid stalemate has to be broken,” he said.\n",

      "https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-in-no-rush-to-strike-deal-with-imf-finance-minister/\n",
      "publish date:  December 15, 2018\n",

      " Business Desk (December 15, 2018): Finance Minister Asad Umar said that Pakistan is in no rush to strike a deal with International Monetary Fund to deal with its balance-of-payments issue.\n",
      "In an interview with Saudi daily Arab News, he said that funding from friendly countries would help shore up the economy over the remaining current financial year.\n",
      "Asad Umar said that we are in discussions with IMF and trying to reach the outlines of the program. However, he said that we will go ahead and sign the programme only if it is in the best interests of Pakistan’s economy.\n",
      "The Finance Minister said that Pakistan has satisfied all concerns raised by the IMF and US officials with regard to CPEC.About trade with India, he ruled out any discussions in this regard before general elections there next year. Asad Umar said that Pakistan would not take any unilateral step to grant Most Favoured Nation trade status to India.\n",
      "On the government’s promise of attracting investment from overseas Pakistanis, he said that rules for a diaspora bond were approved by the Cabinet a week ago and the bond would be issued late this month or next month.\n",
      "“The recent support has resulted in a current account deficit of $6-7 billion less than the previous financial year,” the finance minister claimed. “Funding from “friendly countries” would help shore up the economy over the remainder of the current financial year,” he added.\n",
      "Referring to the $6-billion package agreed with Saudi Arabia this October and expected aid from China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Umar added, “So I’ve saved $6-7 billion of my financing need and then I’ve arranged funding from bilateral sources to bridge the gap.”\n",
      "When asked how much aid Pakistan expects from China and UAE, Umar refused to provide a figure for packages but said that, in both cases, it was just a case of “dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s” on the agreements.Turning to the recent plummeting that the rupee took against the dollar Umar denied that the government had allowed the rupee’s value to drop in order to fulfill a precondition of an IMF bailout. “The main sticking point in negotiations with the organisation was the pace of reforms,” Umar added.\n",
      "“We believe that if you try and make reforms too quickly, if you try and make an adjustment too quickly, you’ll crash the economy. And that is not in our interests, not even from a debt-sustainability point of view,” he asserted.\n",
      "CPEC plans review not off the table\n",
      "Responding to a question regarding reviewing agreements related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) programme was off the table, Umar said: “Not at all.”“The IMF had a lot of questions. The Americans had a lot of questions around CPEC,” he said. “We made a presentation, we shared the data with them — first meeting. They never came back after that.”\n",

      "His father, Makhdoom Muhammmad Zaman was the 17th spiritual leader of Sarwari Jammat and as well a powerful feudal figure in the province.His father was one of the prominent 67 participants who laid the foundation of the Pakistan Peoples Party where he was made the senior vice-chairman of the party and PPP was found at his house in Hala, Sindh. Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman ‘Talib ul Mola’ successfully contested in the 1970 general elections and stepped into the national parliament as a member of parliament (MP).\n",
      "Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman was also offered many high-ranking posts in the time of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, but he refused and chose to stay in Hala and look after his Sarwari Jamaat.\n",
      "Earning Bachelor of Science in political science from the University of Sindh in 1961, Amin started his political activism in 1970 and contested successfully in the 1970 general elections and was a close ally of Benazir Bhutto during the 1990s.\n",

He was the senior vice-chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, Chairman of Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians and Former Chairman of Alliance for Restoration of Democracy.\n",
      "Makhdoom was offered the post of Prime Minister in 2002 by then President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, keeping in mind his party’s leader Benazir Bhutto’s refusal to appoint Mr. Amin Fahim’s son Makhdoom Jameel Zaman as the Chief Minister Sindh, though he was offered the post of Prime Minister thrice before 1988–1990 and 1993.\n",

He was Communications Minister from December 1988 to August 1990, Railways Minister from December 1988 to March 1989. In the next tenure, he was Minister for Housing and Works from January 1994 to November 1996.\n",
      "Initially, Makhdoom Amin Fahim was more interested in poetry than politics. However, he had no choice but to jump into the fray as the political heir of Makhdoom family.\n",
      "He once said, ‘Poetry is my first love. I am still fond of saying verses and reading poetry of others’ His forte is mystic poetry. His poetry speaks about love, Peace, and simplicity.“I have always been fond of the poetry of Maulana Rumi, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, and Sachal Sarmast. Their poetry has left a deep impact on my life. I have learned from them (Poets) to be loyal, to be loved, in good or rainy days”\n",
      "He further said, ‘I don’t believe in ruling the people. I believe in ruling their hearts. That is why my voters love me, and they never disappointed me’.\n",

      "Shahzad Akbar said that the government will ask NAB to hold independent investigation and we are going to hand over the record of Prime Minister House from 2014 to 2018 to NAB.He said that the properties owned by Sharif family in London are also under scrutiny and its details have been sought from British government.\n",
      "He said that investigative journalists were his closest partners in the responsibility he had been given.\n",
      "He said that a media channel had broken the news of a property [Frederick Close] located in Central London which “had a current value of 2.2 or 2.3 million pounds”.\n",
      "Akbar added that the rental income and ownership documents for this property from 2012 to 2016 had been available “but were put away in files”.\n",
      "According to these documents, the flat in London was under the name of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, the late wife of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.The special assistant to PM said that as the premier and a member of the National Assembly (MNA), it was Nawaz Sharif’s responsibility to declare the ownership of his dependents, including his wife’s.\n",

      "He said that further investigation of assets beyond known income should be carried out by NAB while tax related liability has been given to the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR).While saying that the case will be pursued by both [NAB and FBR], Akbar added that they have also asked Britain for fresh ownership documents of the concerned property.\n",
      "Akbar said that according to the land registry, in August 2016 this property was transferred to Hassan Nawaz’s name.\n",
      "The latest date for its sale is from March 2018, Akbar added.\n",

      "“The question comes up again which has remained the question in all the cases: where did these properties come from, what was their source of income, and what is their trail of money.“When you don’t declare something and get caught, the first question is where did it come from, you have to declare a source of income for it,” he remarked.\n",
      "In July this year, an accountability court in its verdict in the Avenfield properties corruption reference had handed the ousted prime minister 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and his daughter Maryam was given 7 years for abetment after she was found “instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father”.

      "While stressing the challenge of identifying the culprits, he noted that a website claiming to be associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russia-based troll farm, published a list of Instagram accounts they said that they had created.Facebook had already shut down most of those accounts, and blocked the rest after an internal investigation, according to Gleicher.\n",

      "The bill titled “Ratification of Foreign Agreements by Parliament Bill, 2018” had been moved by Rabbani, the former Senate chairman, in August.Through the bill, the PPP leader has called upon the government to place a foreign agreement, contract or protocol to be signed with any country before both the houses of the parliament to seek approval of its draft within 15 days of its finalisation.\n",
      "Speaking in the upper house today, Rabbani said it is a practice in some countries that all agreements are ratified by the parliament.\n",

      "Commenting on the proposal, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said although he principally had no objections against the bill, there is no uniform practice around the world regarding ratification of agreements and treaties by the parliament.“Many countries do not get agreements ratified by the lawmakers,” he informed the Senate. A situation of uncertainty can be created by frequent amendments to international treaties, on which talks can last for several years, he added.\n",
      "“A method of review should be devised that doesn’t become a hindrance in the [signing of agreements],” he stressed.\n",
      "Opposition Leader in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq supported the bill, saying matters like foreign agreements should not stay confined to the executive and that the parliament should have a say in them.\n",
      "After hearing all opinions on the proposal, Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani sent the bill to the relevant committee.\n",

      " Washington (November 07, 2018): Democrats have taken back control of the House of Representatives but not won a majority in the Senate as the historic “blue wave” they hoped for failed to materialise at the midterm elections.\n",
      "The achievement means that the Republicans no longer hold both wings of the US Congress, handing Donald Trump’s political opponents a stronger foothold in Washington from which to oppose his presidency.\n",
      "The Democrats now have the numbers to veto Mr Trump’s proposed laws in the House and launch a string of damaging investigations into his administration through the committees they will control.\n",
      "However in the Senate it was a different story, with Republicans unseating a string of Democratic senators up for re-election in states Mr Trump won in 2016. It indicates many of the president’s supporters are still with him two years into office.Projections suggested the Republicans could even increase their majority in the Senate, allowing them to push ahead with controversial judicial and cabinet appointments with less fear of rebellions. Mr Trump, quick to put his spin on a night of mixed results, tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: “Anybody that was anticipating a blue wave tonight is not going to get it.”\n",
      "In some of the most closely watched races, Democrats lost out. Beto O’Rourke, who had become a pinup for American liberals by running a surprisingly competitive race in Texas, ultimately fell short, with Ted Cruz winning re-election as the state’s senator.\n",
      "Andrew Gillum, the left-leaning Democrat who was hoping to become Florida’s first ever black governor, was also defeated, narrowly losing to Trump acolyte Ron DeSantis. A number of historic landmarks were reached, with the first Muslim congresswomen, first openly gay male governor and the youngest ever congresswoman (aged 29) all being elected.The story of the night was that of two different battles playing out – one for control of the House and another for the Senate. In the House races, all eyes were on America’s suburbs. Democrats quickly made gains but failed to pick off seats which would have indicated they were on course for a landslide.\n",
      "One Republican senator close to Mr Trump, Lindsey Graham, admitted the party would have to address its “suburban women problem” as the Democrats gained seats. Their control of the House will be a huge headache for Mr Trump. His legislative agenda will grind to a hold, with the chances of securing new funding for his US-Mexico border or another tax cut significantly diminished.\n",
      "The White House is also braced for Democrat-controlled House committees to launch many probes that could damage the president on everything from his tax returns to ties to Russia, using their power to order witnesses to testify. Nancy Pelosi, the woman expected to become the new Democrat Speaker of the House, said in a celebratory speech that Wednesday would be a “new day in America”, adding: “We’ve all had enough of division.”\n",

      " Web Desk (November 7, 2018): Americans created history on Tuesday when they elected two Muslim women – Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib – to Congress.\n",
      "Although Muslim men have been elected to Congress before, Ilhan and Rashida are the first Muslim women to represent Americans in the US House of Representatives. Ilhan, 37, was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, on October 4, 1981. In 2016, she was elected a Democratic Party member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, making her the first Somali-American legislator elected to a public office in the United States.A hijab-wearing mother of three, Ilhan is married to a Somali-American Ahmed Hirsi. She has a bachelor’s degree in politics from North Dakota State University and has also studied public affairs.\n",
      "She won the Democratic primary on August 14, 2018, and contested the election on a party ticket.\n",
      "Ilhan’s father, Nur Omar Mohamed, is a teacher trainer. Her mother died when Ilhan was a child and she was raised by her father and grandfather. After the start of the civil war in 1991, she and her family fled Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. In 1995, they emigrated to the United States, initially settling in Arlington, Virginia and then moving to Minneapolis.\n",
      "Ilhan ran from Minnesota’s 5th district, a deeply Democratic area previously represented by a fellow Muslim, Keith Ellison, who won six terms from here.\n",
      "She beat Republican Jennifer Zielinski to take Keith Ellison’s seat, which he vacated to run for Minnesota attorney general.\n",
      "Rashida Tlaib:Technically, Palestinian-American Rashida Harbi Tlaib is the first American Muslim woman to be elected to Congress. Although her election was officially announced on Tuesday, she was elected unopposed as no one came forward to challenge Rashida in another deeply Democratic district.\n",
      "Rashida, who is associated with a socialist group within the Democratic Party, is also very popular in this constituency.\n",
      "On January 1, 2009, Rashida became the first Muslim American woman to serve in the Michigan Legislature, and the second Muslim woman in history to be elected to any US state legislature.\n",
      "In 2018, she won the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 13th congressional district and won unopposed. She was born on July 24, 1976, to working-class Palestinian immigrants in Detroit and is the eldest of 14 children. Her parents were both born in Palestine.\n",
      "Rashida played a major role in raising her siblings as her parents worked or relied on welfare are for support.\n",
      "She graduated from Wayne State University with a BA in political science in 1998 and in 2004, she earned a law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\n",
      "Rashida is also the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress.\n",

      " Lahore (November 04, 2018): Polling for the two vacant seats of senate from Punjab will be held on 15th of November in Punjab Assembly.\n",
      "The seats fell vacant due to disqualification of PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar Khan and Sadia Abbasi.\n",
      "Earlier on October 25, the election commission had de-notified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi in the light of Supreme Court’s verdict in dual nationality case.On October 17, the Supreme Court disqualified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi for still holding dual nationalities at the time of filing their nomination papers for the upper house of the parliament.\n",
      "Bilal Manto, who was assisting the SC in the case, said that whether or not a nationality could be completely renounced depends on that particular country’s laws.\n",

      "\n",
      "Citing Canada as an example, Manto said that the Canadian law does not allow its citizens to give up its nationality altogether once it has been procured.\n",
      "Following Manto’s argument, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar gave the orders of disqualification under Article 63 (1)(c) of the 1973 Constitution.During the hearing, Justice Nisar said that while the time of a person renouncing a nationality can be counted from the day they write to their respective embassy to relieve them of the second nationality, the letter should already be written at the time a candidate submits their nomination papers for a public office.\n",
      "“This was not the case for Abbasi,” the chief justice observed.\n",
      "The chief justice also told the counsels of Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and PML-N’s Nuzhat Sadiq to furnish their clients’ verified affidavits showing that they had given up their second nationalities before filing their nomination papers.\n",

      " Lahore (October 31, 2018): The chairman of the newly formed Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) committee Mohsin Khan has suggested that Sarfraz Ahmed should be relieved of the Pakistan Test team captaincy.\n",
      "Mohsin Khan aired his views about Sarfraz during an interview. “I have said it before and I will say it now too, with Sarfraz I was saying you got a new guy in and don’t put the burden of three formats on him.” “It will take such a physical load on him, T20s, ODIs and then Tests; if he is captain he will not get any mental relaxation.”\n",
      "Khan further said, “Sarfraz’s body language was so down. I felt sorry for him that he’s had so much pressure put on him, with T20s, ODIs and Tests. There’s no doubt he is so talented and it’s not as if he is 35-36.”\n",
      "“He is young, he has a lot of time. That was my view before and it is now as well,” he added. Earlier On October 26, the PCB announced a four-member special committee to oversee all cricketing matters in the country.\n",
      "Former cricketer and selector Mohsin Khan has been named the chairman of the committee. Former captains Wasim Akram, Misbah-ul-Haq, Urooj Mumtaz are the other three members of the committee who will meet the chief selector and coach (men, women and junior teams) three times in a year, and review plans for the development of umpires, referees and curators.\n",
      "The team management and the selection committee are unhappy with Khan’s comments about Sarfraz, according to the PCB sources.“It is incorrect to say such things about an in-form captain who just led the team to a Test series win against Australia,” the sources said.\n",
      "“Before becoming the chairman Mohsin used unacceptable words for coach Mickey Arthur too,” the sources added.\n",
      "“People were not taken into confidence over the appointment of the committee chairman,” the sources said, adding, “Chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq is not happy with the formation of the committee.”\n",

      " Islamabad (October 26, 2018): Former Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on Friday challenged the Supreme Judicial Council’s decision removing his as a high court judge.\n",
      "In his constitutional petition, filed in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, Siddiqui stated that he was discriminately sacked on account of making a public speech.\n",
      "Click On Play Button To Watch This Video\n",
      "\n",
      "The former IHC judge contended that he has been sacked without a proper inquiry to prove his claims in the speech he delivered at the Rawalpindi Bar Association.\n",
      "He also alleged that the SJC order “suffered from various illegalities and malafides” and prayed to the apex court to set aside the notification and restore his position as IHC judge.\n",
      "In his appeal, Siddiqui stated: “In view of the historical evolution of procedure for removal from high public office through an impeachment under the public gaze and open proceedings, the action against the petitioner [Siddiqui] is violative of rule of law and judgements of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.”\n",
      "The former IHC judge also claimed that SJC members were biased against him, saying that his removal “in an illegal manner was part of [a] preconceived plan of the worthy chairman of the SJC who intended to deprive the petitioner judge [Siddiqui] from becoming the chief justice of [the] Islamabad High Court. A plan is now afoot to bring ‘his man’ as a chief justice of [the] Islamabad High Court This is itself sufficient ground to establish the malafide exercise of power by the Chairman.”Siddiqui pleaded the apex court to withdraw the notification of his removal and restore him as IHC judge.\n",
      "President Arif Alvi had removed Siddiqui as judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council (SCJ) on October 11.\n",
      "The decision was taken by five members of the SJC led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar. Other judges on the panel included: Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, Justice Gulzar Ahmad, Lahore High Court’s Chief Justice Yawar Ali and Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court Justice Ahmed Ali Sheikh.\n",
      "Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who is senior most among SC judges, wrote in the 39-page report that Justice Siddiqui did not even spare the Supreme Court when he remarked that he knew who sent messages to the apex court and who delivered them.Such reckless and irresponsible conduct of a high court judge was “not countenanced by any standard of judicial propriety and the Code of Conduct in this country is no exception in that regard”, the report stated.\n",
      "The SJC had unanimously opined that while delivering the speech before the District Bar Association in Rawalpindi on July 21, “Siddiqui, an IHC judge, displayed a conduct unbecoming of a high court judge”.\n",
      "On July 20, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had made serious allegations against personnel of a security agency, claiming that they were manipulating judicial proceedings. He also claimed the agencies approached the IHC chief justice to ensure Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz remained behind bars for the elections.\n",
      "On July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.\n",
      "On Oct 11, a letter written by the SJC had emerged, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July. Later in the day, President Arif Alvi removed him. According to a statement, issued by the federal law ministry, the president took the decision after the SJC recommended his removal.\n",

      "After being sworn in, President Sahle-Work promised to work hard to make gender equality a reality in Ethiopia.

Ms Sahle-Work’s appointment has been welcomed by Ethiopians on social media with many calling it “historic”.\n",

To which, I hit the roof and told the officials to bring forward the evidence and I will apologise in Parliament,” he said while adding that they then stepped back and he warned the officials that this conversation is on record. “I told them you are involving our trusted friends in this low allegation,” he added. “Then, the officer blamed that the assets may be ‘benami’, I challenged this too. And they stepped back from it too.”\n",

      "The information minister asserted, “Not even a single case against the Sharif brothers was initiated by us.”\n",
      "Further, commenting on Shehbaz’s speech, Chaudhry said, “I was very glad that the opposition leader repeatedly said he will be ashamed and leave the Parliament if corruption is proven against him but I want to ask if the same rules apply on his brother.”\n",
      "“I want to also clarify that cases against Shehbaz will not affect Pakistan and China’s relations,” he added while dismissing the PML-N president’s statements. “Today, our relations with UAE, China, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia are the strongest they have ever been and are continuing to gain strength.”He further commended the NA speaker for issuing Shehbaz’s production orders and said, “The government stands with the opposition on several matters.”\n",

      "Stating that his political career spans over 30 years, Shah said, “There should be an investigation regarding where we have done this corruption that they [government] speaks of.”\n",
      "“We do not know politics of hurling abuses,” he added. Earlier, PPP leader Khursheed Shah opposed Chaudhry taking to the floor and said it had been agreed that the government will respond towards the end of the session.\n",
      "The information minister then asked, “If you don’t let us then talk then should we let you?” However, the NA speaker then asked Shah to address the session.\n",

      "Speaking about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz’s arrest, Shehbaz said, “For the first time, a father was imprisoned in front of his daughter and a daughter in front of her father.”\n",
      "Shehbaz added, “We expect the speaker to rise above likes and dislikes and to take action against intrusion in democracy.”\n",
      "“As a public representative, Pakistani and a humble political worker I want to tell you [NA Speaker] that I have done nothing except for serving the people honestly,” he said and added that the Parliament will have to decide whether the “law of the jungle” will prevail.Delving into details regarding the Ashiana Housing Scheme, Shehbaz said, “It was alleged that I gave the contract to former army chief General (retd) Ashfaq Parvez Kayani’s brother to please him. However, I met Kamran Kayani for the first time in 2008. He had been awarded the contract by the Punjab government that was led by Pervez Elahi.”\n",

      "“An inquiry under the supervision of then finance secretary Tariq Bajwa, who is the current governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), was carried out into the contract.

What is this joke?” he asked.“Is this tabdeeli that you snatch morsels from people,” he questioned. “This is not tabdeeli or Naya Pakistan but something else.”\n",
      "“The NAB official told me that there is evidence that my children and I have investments in China and Turkey. To which, I hit the roof and told the officials to bring forward the evidence and I will apologise in Parliament,” he said while adding that they then stepped back and he warned the officials that this conversation is on record. “I told them you are involving our trusted friends in this low allegation,” he added. “Then, the officer blamed that the assets may be ‘benami’, I challenged this too. And they stepped back from it too.”\n",

      "He further said, “I was asked to testify against Khawaja Asif. To which I asked NAB officials if they have called me to issue statements against people and requested them to question me in the case that I have been taken in custody for. I have also complained to NAB director regarding this.”\n",

      " Islamabad (October 11, 2018): President Arif Alvi has removed Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as a judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), a notification issued by the law ministry said on Thursday.\n",
      "The president took the decision after the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommended his removal, the statement added.\n",
      "A letter written by the SJC had emerged earlier in the day, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July earlier this year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.“The council is unanimously of the opinion that in the matter of making his speech before the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi on [July 21] Mr. Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui […] had displayed conduct unbecoming of a judge of a high court and was, thus, guilty of misconduct and he is, therefore, liable to be removed from his office under Article 209(6) of the Constitution,” the communication read.\n",
      "While addressing an audience at the bar, Justice Siddiqui had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.\n",
      "He had further claimed that the spy agency had approached IHC Chief Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi and said: “‘We do not want to let Nawaz Sharif and his daughter come out [of the prison] until elections, do not include Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on the bench [hearing Sharifs’ appeals]’.”\n",
      "Justice Siddiqui had offered no evidence to support the claims he made.The IHC judge was facing a reference over his controversial speech, the third reference filed against him.\n",
      "On July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments at the Rawalpindi District Bar Association by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.\n",
      "The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.\n",
      "The council did not consider another request of Justice Siddiqui to hold the proceedings of this reference in the open court.\n",
      "The judge had been alrea­dy facing a reference on misconduct earlier moved on the complaint by some retired employees of the Capital Development Authori­ty (CDA) for alleged refurbishment of his official residence beyond entitlement.\n",
      "Likewise, a similar show-cause notice was issued to Justice Siddiqui under Article 209 (5)(6) of the Constitution by the SJC on a reference moved by Advocate Kulsum Khaliq on behalf of former member of the National Asse­mbly Jamsh­ed Ahmed Dasti alleging that the high court judge had, during one of the hearings on a case relating to the 20-day Faizabad sit-in, objected to a compromise between the federal government and the protesting Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah. The compromise was facilitated by the armed forces.\n",
      "After scrutinising the reference, a meeting of the SJC held on Feb 6 observed that the judge was guilty of misconduct and should be issued a show-cause notice in this regard.\n",

      "If political victimisation is not ended, we will take the protest beyond the Parliament, Sanaullah warned.\n",

Former NA speaker Ayaz Sadiq chaired the mock session, in which a ‘call to attention’ notice was also presented regarding the arrest of Shahbaz Sharif.Earlier this week, the PML-N had demanded that Shahbaz Sharif, who is currently in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) custody, should be brought to parliament so he can present his case before the people of the country.\n",
      "Sharif has been arrested on the charge that he tried to influence the transfer of a contract for the Ashiana Housing Scheme from one contractor to another.\n",
      "On Wednesday, NA Speaker Asad Qaiser issued directives to convene the session requested by opposition parties on October 17. Additionally, the NA Secretariat also issued production orders to ensure the presence of Shahbaz Sharif for that session.\n",

      "While addressing the mock session, PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain said that Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were put behind bars ahead of the general elections and now they have arrested Shahbaz Sharif ahead of the by-polls.\n",

      "During an interview to Bloomberg, Prince Muhammad said, Riyadh has the power to protect its territory and interest. We will not pay a single riyal for national security to anyone.Media Minister Awwad bin Saleh Al-Awwad said after the session that the Cabinet reviewed reports on the latest regional and international developments and events.\n",
      "“Saudi Arabia provided over the past eight years $1.03 billion in humanitarian assistance to refugees around the world, $239.7 million in assistance through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and $93.2 million through the International Organization for Migration (IOM),” he added.The Cabinet condemned a suicide attack that targeted an election rally in eastern Afghanistan, and a terrorist attack that targeted a military convoy in southeast Turkey, killing and injuring dozens.\n",
      "Earlier on October 06, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said: “Actually we will pay nothing for our security.” The Kingdom pays for all its military equipment from the US, he said.  “We believe that all the armaments we have from the United States of America are paid for, it’s not free armament.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The crown prince said relations with the US are still strong despite comments by Donald Trump that the Kingdom must pay for American military support.\n",
      "Since the beginning of Saudi-US relations “we’ve bought everything with money,” the crown prince told a group of reporters on Wednesday.Saudi Arabia changed its military spending strategy after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, with 60% of spending with the US over a decade, the prince said.\n",
      "“That’s why we’ve created the $400 billion in opportunities, armaments and investment opportunities, and other trade opportunities,” which Prince Mohammed said was a good achievement for both countries.\n",
      "The various deals, which were signed in 2017 when President Trump made Saudi Arabia his first overseas visit, means that “part of these armaments will be manufactured in Saudi Arabia, so it will create jobs in America and Saudi Arabia, good trade, good benefits for both countries and also good economic growth. Plus, it will help our security,” he said.President Trump and King Salman launched a global counter-terror center in Riyadh during his visit to the country.\n",
      "Prince Mohammed visited Washington in March where the president hailed the links between the two allies. “The relationship is probably the strongest it’s ever been,” Trump said at a joint press conference.\n",
      "“We have huge investments between both countries. We have good improvement in our trade – a lot of achievements, so this is really great,” the prince said on Wednesday.\n",
      "The US-Saudi efforts, along with global partners, have pushed back extremists and terrorists and countered Iran’s “negative moves in the Middle East in a good way,” he told the journalists.On the topic of controlling oil prices, the crown prince said the Kingdom has never “decided that this is the right or wrong oil price. The oil price depends on trade – consumer and supplier – and they decide the oil price based on trade and supply and demand.\n",
      "What we are committed in Saudi Arabia is to make sure there is no shortage of supply. So we work with our allies in OPEC and also non-OPEC countries to be sure that we have a sustainable supply of oil and there is no shortage and that there is good demand, that it will not create problems for the consumers and their plans and development,” he said.\n",
      "Prince Mohammed confirmed that Trump did make a request to Saudi Arabia and OPEC to replace whatever may be lost of supply from Iran. “And that happened.  Because recently, Iran reduced their exports by 700,000 barrels a day, if I’m not mistaken. And Saudi Arabia and OPEC and non-OPEC countries, they’ve produced 1.5 million barrels a day. So we export as much as 2 barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently. So we did our job and more.We believe the higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran. It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada, and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela and other countries that moved the price a little bit higher. But Iran, definitely no. Because they reduced 700,000 barrels and we’ve exported more than 1.5 million barrels a day,” the crown prince said.\n",
      "Earlier on October 03, Trump warned the Saudi ruler that he might not survive without US support.\n",
      "President Trump claims he once warned Saudi Arabia’s King Salman that he wouldn’t last in power without help from the U.S. Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We protect Saudi Arabia… And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, ‘King, we’re protecting you, you might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military.’”He did not say when he issued the warning, but the two had a phone conversation on Saturday in which they discussed oil-market stability and global economic growth, according to Saudi media.\n",
      "The president complained about the U.S. supposedly “subsidizing” Saudi Arabia’s military at a rally in West Virginia that same day.\n",

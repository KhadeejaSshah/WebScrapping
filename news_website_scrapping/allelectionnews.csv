As per the data shared by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), a total of 17,816 candidates are in the run, including 12,695 for provincial assemblies and 5,121 for National Assembly seats.
They include 16,930 males, 882 females and four transgender persons. The political parties have fielded 6,031 candidates, including 5,726 males and 275 females. A record number of 11,785 independents are also in the race, including 11,174 males, 607 females and four transgender persons.
According to the ECP, the political parties have fielded 1,873 male and 93 female candidates for 266 general seats of the National Assembly with 3,248 independents, including 3,027 males, 2,019 females and two transgender persons in the fray.
Similarly, there are 12,695 candidates for 593 provincial assembly constituencies, including 12,123 males, 570 women and two transgender persons.
Women form 46% (59.3 million) and men 54% (69.2 million) of the total registered voters. However, more than 56 million young voters between the age brackets of 18-25 and 26-35 years are being seen as potential factor in shaping the legislatures.
The cliffhanger electoral contest will feature 28.74 million voters in the age group of 36 to 45 years.
Those on the premises of a polling station would be allowed to exercise their right to vote after the time is over. The voters will elect the National Assembly members who will then by majority vote choose the next prime minister.
Likewise, the voters will also elect lawmakers to their respective four provincial assemblies, who will then elect the chief ministers.
Over 260 million ballots — half of them green and half white — have already been printed and delivered to the presiding officers by road and air to over 90,000 polling stations under a security cover provided by the police and other law-enforcement agencies.
Security plan
To ensure the security of voters and polling staff, 648,000 security personnel have been deployed for poll duties, including 137,000 military and 511,000 police personnel. The commission has already issued the election code of conduct.
As many as 90,675 polling stations have been established across the country, out of which more than half have been declared as sensitive or most sensitive.
The army will serve as the third layer of security in Quick Response Force mode; however, two army personnel each will be deployed outside over 18,000 highly sensitive polling stations. Their entry in the polling stations will depend on the requirement of presiding officers.
During the last over five years, for the first time a prime minister had to go home after a no-trust motion. Some prominent politicians, including Imran Khan, Ch Shujaat Hussain, Asfandyar Wali and Shah Mehmood Qureshi, are not contesting owing to different reasons.
Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif is back from abroad and is looking for his fourth term as the country’s chief executive.
Speculations are rife that in view of the prevailing political and electoral situation, no political party in the Centre may be able to form the government and hence a coalition setup is being predicted after the elections.
Besides the youth, independents are expected to mainly decide the shape of legislatures.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also fielded its candidates as independents. Their alignment, which according to rules, has to be made within three days after the publication of returned candidates, will be crucial and major political stakeholders will be trying to lure them for support. Of the total 336 members, 169 members can form a simple majority government.
Owing to the death of contesting candidates, election proceedings have already been terminated in four national and provincial assembly constituencies. These are NA-8 Bajaur, PK-22 Bajaur, PK-91 Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and PP-266 Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab.
In a related development, the Election Commission has taken notice of continuous running of political advertisements, statements and texts on electronic media and has directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to hold all such channels accountable and ensure adherence to Section 182 of the Elections Act 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media.
The commission has reminded Pemra that under Section 182 of the Elections Act, 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media, after 12 midnight on February 6, there is a ban on the election campaign, advertisements and other written material on electronic and print media and strict action should be taken against the channels violating this ban.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission spokesman has said the commission has suspended an officer of the Information Group Pir Suleman Shah Rashdi for violation of the code of conduct and misconduct by issuing a video message for support of a particular political party’s candidates. However, he added the officer will be able to draw his salary, allowances and other benefits during his suspension.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has announced that the internet service would continue uninterrupted countrywide. In a statement, the Authority said there won’t be an internet shutdown on the Election Day.

3,Pakistan Election 2024: Can ECP handle tsunami of tech-powered propaganda?,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-election-2024-can-ecp-handle-tsunami-of-tech-powered-propaganda/,"February 8, 2024","The 2024 polls will differ significantly from previous ones, with over 128 million voters, comprising more than half of the population, and witnessing an additional 42.3 million individuals added to the electoral roll since the 2013 polls.
In the upcoming polls scheduled for February 8, the youth will be a deciding factor, as voters under the age of 35 constitute 44% of the total electorate. Whichever political party can convince this age group stands to win elections easily, because this demographic eats, drinks, and sleeps internet.
In 2018, during the last polls, the country had over 44 million social media users, making the use of new media technology more significant in political communication than ever before.
While the 2013 polls are considered the country’s first social media elections, the 2024 ones are the biggest ever in terms of technology use, with 87.35 million internet users in January 2023.
Moreover, Pakistan is home to 71.70 million social media users, constituting 30% of the total population, bringing about a significant change in political communication.
However, this scenario has its pros, but it also comes with its cons. While technology has boosted campaigning, it has also given rise to serious misgivings as this picture also has a darker side, which harbours active dissemination of disinformation and fake news. Given these real-time concerns, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has, for the first time, included digital media in its code of conduct for the 2024 polls.
The commission, in its notification, specifically mentions terms like social media influencers, digital media, and verified social media accounts, indicating its readiness for this new challenge.
“During the election campaign, the content floated on print, electronic and digital media, shall not reflect any opinion prejudicial to the ideology, sovereignty, dignity or security of Pakistan, public order or the integrity and independence of the judiciary of Pakistan and other national institutions,” the ECP state in its notification.
Despite the challenges of the new information system, political parties have adapted to new methods, from constituency-wise WhatsApp channels to TikTok jalsas (public meetings), in efforts to woo the younger generation. This has compelled government authorities to come up with new policies and monitoring tools.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party of former prime minister Imran Khan, has been highly innovative in the use of advanced technologies, changing the way campaigning is done in Pakistan.
With the use of artificial intelligence, the launching of a dedicated portal for candidates, and the introduction of a Facebook bot, the PTI has been leading the charge. However, the credit for these creativities could easily be given to a myriad of gags imposed on the party by the state.
In this regard, the Election Commission has updated its policies, incorporating several new topics to cover different aspects of social media. However, some aspects lack clarity, leaving room for manipulation. For instance, the ECP didn’t explain how it would determine “official accounts” on social media, as it is now convenient for anyone to get an account verified on X by making a payment.
Moreover, there’s a need for clarity on social media spending by political parties and candidates, as well as virtual canvassing and campaigning, as per Sections 177 and 182 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Experts have urged the commission to enforce these policies rigorously, as other government bodies are tasked to assist in carrying out its functions. State institutions, such as the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Press Information Department (PID) Cyber Wing, and Digital Media Wing of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB), are responsible for monitoring coverage.
Sharing her concerns, AbbTakk Factcheck Editor Benazir Shah said: “I don’t think that the ECP is going to be able to or has the required facilities and the resources to monitor social media”.
Considering the ever-expanding social media landscape riddled with various fast-mutating platforms, Shah pointed out a disruptive change. She said the brands were increasingly flocking to TikTok for their campaigns, making the most of its extensive outreach. She added that as the AI-generated visuals were all the rage these days, social media marketing had never been better.
“I don’t think the ECP has the resources. The last time that I got an estimate from ECP they said they had around 4,000 to 5,000 employees. And not only that, you need a dedicated wing of people who specialise in monitoring social media and who know how to keep a track of it and also be able to do it around the clock.”
Shah highlighted that she hadn’t read anywhere that the ECP had set up any kind of a wing that is dedicated to monitoring the digital media and the election campaigns on it.
“So, until and unless that happens, I think this is just a mere formality that they’re fulfilling.”
Echoing the concerns, Digital Rights Foundation chief Nighat Dad, in an opinion piece for The News, wrote that while the ECP has laid down a framework for campaign expenditures it doesn’t clearly mention whether it applies strictly to physical campaigning. Hence, it can be argued that the broader application of law can cover both offline and online campaign financing.
“Thousands of political ads run on social media during the days leading up to elections in Pakistan, especially on Facebook and YouTube. The regulation of online and social media campaign financing is a relatively new and evolving area, and, unfortunately, the ECP’s policies are silent on accountability around digital political ads,” she stated.
Dad shared that countries like the US have developed measures in this regard and are enforced strictly, adding platforms have their own policies which include background checks and transparency requirements.
“A pressing question is: how much can candidates and their supporters spend on online political campaigns in Pakistan? The lack of explicit regulations by the ECP on online political advertising leaves a significant area of campaign financing unregulated. This gap allows for the potential misuse of online platforms for electioneering without adequate oversight or accountability,” she further added.

10,Erdogan exposes west saying its leaders cannot even call on Israel for ceasefire,https://abbtakk.tv/en/erdogan-exposes-saying-western-leaders-cannot-even-call-on-israel-for-a-ceasefire-let-alone-react-to-it/,"October 29, 2023","ISTANBUL: President Tayyip Erdogan addressed hundreds of thousands of supporters at one of the largest pro-Palestinian rallies since the Israel-Hamas war began, courting his political base a day ahead of the centenary of Turkey’s secular republic.
“Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it,” Erdogan told the crowd in Istanbul, who waved Palestinian flags.
“We will tell the whole world that Israel is a war criminal. We are making preparations for this. We will declare Israel a war criminal,” he said.
In an hour-long speech, Erdogan also repeated his assertion that Hamas was not a terrorist organisation, describing Israel as an occupier.
Turkey has condemned Israeli civilian deaths caused by Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,400, but Erdogan this week called the group Palestinian “freedom fighters”.
He also criticised some Western nations’ unconditional support for Israel, drawing sharp rebukes from Italy and Israel.
Unlike many NATO allies, the European Union, and some Gulf states, Turkey does not consider Hamas a “terrorist” organisation. It has long hosted its members, supports a two-state solution, and has offered to play a role in negotiating the release of hostages abducted by Hamas during the October 7 assault.
Political analysts said Erdogan was keen to reinforce his criticism of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip and to overshadow Sunday’s celebrations marking Turkey’s secular roots.
Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and director of the Centre for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, an Istanbul-based think-tank, said Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis and pressure from political allies had prompted Erdogan to sharpen his rhetoric.
Turkey “will protect its principles and share these with the international community, but it needs to do this with a more delicate diplomacy if it expects to play such a diplomatic role,” Ulgen said.
The heads of allied nationalist and religious parties — which helped Erdogan secure victory in tight May elections — attended the rally at Istanbul’s old airport. Erdogan criticised opposition parties for not calling Netanyahu a “terrorist” and for using the same term with reference to Hamas.
Ataturk legacyErdogan had invited all Turks to attend the rally where he said “only our flag and the Palestine flag will wave”. His AK Party had predicted more than a million people would come.
Modern Turkey’s 100th anniversary comes on Sunday when newspaper headlines could be dominated by news of the Saturday rally rather than celebrations of the republic’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, analysts say.
Erdogan, Turkey’s longest-serving leader, and his AK Party have eroded support for the Western-facing ideals of Ataturk. In recent years, Erdogan’s portraits have appeared alongside those of Ataturk on government buildings and schools.
“The symbolism is clear and no one in Turkey is unaware of it — that the pro-Palestinian rally is likely to overshadow celebrations for the centennial of the secular republic,” said Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.
She said that while Erdogan’s comments about Hamas reflected Ankara’s long-held position, he aimed to benefit from anti-Israel sentiment domestically and “consolidate Turkey’s Sunni conservatives”.
The government has said the Israel-Hamas conflict will not restrict celebrations of the 100th anniversary, for which it has organised events across the country.

11,Caretaker PM rules out possibility of any delay in general elections,https://abbtakk.tv/en/caretaker-pm-rules-out-possibility-of-any-delay-in-general-elections/,"October 12, 2023","ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Thursday dismissed the impression that the decision of Pakistan Muslim League leader Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan was part of any deal with the interim government. “The caretaker government has ‘no soft corner’ for PML-N or any other political party…How can a caretaker government strike such a deal,” he said in an interview with digital media platform, WE (World Echo) News.
The prime minister was responding to a question relating to the PML-N chief’s homecoming who flew from London to Saudi Arabia yesterday with his announcement to land in Pakistan on October 21. Kakar pointed out that Nawaz Sharif left the country as per the court decision “under the nose of Imran Khan’s government, and not the caretaker setup”. However, he said that if Nawaz Sharif returns and takes part in politics, he will have to face some legal obstacles. “The answers to these legal questions lie in legal remedies,” he said.
Kakar said any leader be it Imran Khan, Asif Ali Zardari, or Nawaz Sharif, everyone would have to seek their legal remedy as per their case scenario.
He said Pakistan was facing the formation of “regimental camps” and the country had been turned into a fighting ground for political positions. He rejected the notion that the caretaker setup could be likened to the 90s ‘Kakar formula’ where both Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan were forced to quit on the proposal of then army chief General Waheed Kakar to make way for fresh election. “This comparison is apples and oranges. It is out of context because in our case, the stint of the normal parliament led to its retirement and we are part of the constitutional continuation where leaders of the House and the Opposition agreed upon my name,” he said.
There has been no interference from any institution in our case, he said.
On general polls, he said necessary security and administrative arrangements were in place. He said the caretaker government in collaboration with the Election Commission was in the process of the finalization of the required measures.
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar has ruled out the possibility of any delay in general elections.
In an interview with a private television channel, he said the polls would be announced and conducted on time and there is no possibility of delay in the elections.
Reiterating the caretaker government’s resolve to hold free and fair elections, the Prime Minister said all registered political parties have legal and constitutional rights to canvass, mobilize people and attract public support.
On the expulsion of Afghan refugees, the prime minister said the action was being taken only against unregistered foreign nationals and over one million illegal aliens. The government’s objective, he said, was to regulate the movement of unregistered foreign nationals through proper process.
On relations with India, he said the radicalized RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) mindset of the ruling Indian party and the Kashmir dispute were the main hurdles in the maintenance of good ties. “The situation between Pakistan and India needs to be improved, however, realistically at present, there is no such possibility,” he said.
PM Kakar said the hegemonic designs of India needed to be curtailed as the country was turning into hell for its minorities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and others.
Asked about any possibility of recognition of Israel, he said, “There are no such deliberations going on.” Pakistan considers Israel an “oppressor” and stands with the rights of Palestinians to their existence and return to their land, he said.
On Pakistan’s economic stability, he said the country for the first time witnessed a reversal of the value of the dollar with a consistent descent of about Rs 40-45.
He said the continuation of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SFIC) would lead to sustainability. He dismissed the impression that the army had taken over the mining sector on the SFIC platform. “The army’s role is a stop-gap arrangement to run the matters and at SFIC, it is providing impetus in the facilitation process,” he said.
He emphasized the need for capacity-building of civil institutions as a pathway for a viable state economically.
In Balochistan, he termed security, governance, scarcity of resources, and mismanagement as the main challenges. He recalled that during the meeting of the apex committee held in Quetta, it was revealed that hundreds of ghost schools and health units existed in the province. “Such mismanagement has led to making a few billionaires but leaving the rest of the population deprived including the common Balochs, Pashtuns, and Hazaras,” he said.

Solangi said the caretaker government’s tenure was extended a little bit due to the approval of fresh census results by the Council of Common Interest.
He pointed to Article 51 (5) of the Constitution, stating that elections would be held in line with the recently approved census after delimitation of the constituencies.
The minister disclosed that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was actively engaged in the delimitation process and announced that preliminary results of the process would be announced on November 27, with the final results set for release on November 30.
In accordance with the Election Act, he said the ECP would have to give 54 days to political parties for their election campaign.
Solangi welcomed the announcement by the ECP that elections would take place in the first week of January, which ended propaganda against the caretaker government.
As regards the criticisms of Fawad Hassan Fawad, who served in the civil service for over 35 years, the minister highlighted that Fawad had worked with various governments.
He stressed that civil servants had no power over choosing their assignments, and that unfounded criticism of someone who had been unjustly imprisoned was unfair.
Solangi also clarified that Fawad Hassan Fawad had no political affiliations. Responding to a query, the minister expressed his commitment to pursuing justice in the Jan Muhammad Mahar murder case, noting that he had personally raised the matter with the interim chief minister of Sindh.
Solangi said the caretaker government had nothing to do with Nawaz Sharif’s matter, adding his cases were in the court, and it was inappropriate to speculate on the issue.
He stressed that all citizens in the country were entitled to their fundamental rights, highlighting the importance of student organizations as a pillar of democracy.
The minister underscored the role of the independent and empowered Election Commission in ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections, with the caretaker government requiring ECP approval for transfer postings.
Solangi said government was actively working to address the issues of workers in newspapers and TV channels.
He confirmed the lawful arrest of journalist Khalid Jamil by the FIA and emphasized adherence to constitutional and legal procedures, including producing individuals before the court within 24 hours.
Solangi said the caretaker government would not interfere in judicial matters.
To another query, he said the institutions were functioning freely and if anybody had any issue, they could reach out the relevant forums.

In the meeting, they discussed important issues including conducting free, fair, and transparent elections and providing facilities to the media during the election process.
The minister said that conducting free, fair, and transparent elections was the common responsibility of the relevant institutions.
He said that media was part and parcel of various stages of the election process as it acted as a bridge for the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Authentic reporting in elections was most important to ensure access to accurate information to the public, Solangi maintained.
Both leaders reiterated their determination to fully cooperate in conducting the elections in a free and transparent manner.

National broadcasters should serve as public service providers, he said, adding the newly appointed MD PTV is highly competent.
He believed that the committed employees of the PTV would bring the national TV at par with modern standards.
Only the PTV had been operating an English News TV channel in the country, he said while underlining the need for initiating public debate over important national issues on TV channels.
He said the PTV should also play its due role in holding free, fair and transparent election by creating awareness among the masses.
The minister said work on holding in-time election was underway and it was essential for all the political parties to work together to create a conducive environment for the election in the country.
The minister ruled out any restriction on media saying “Media cannot overlook journalistic responsibilities.” He said institutions were functioning freely and anybody could approach the relevant forum if had any complain of discrimination during the election campaign.
The minister said the caretaker government was bound to implement the decisions made by the previous government. The caretaker government was a constitutional one and had a limited mandate.
To a query, he said the caretaker government had not been facing any difficulty in handling international affairs with the global community.

Polls will close at 5 pm local time and the first results are expected to start coming in shortly after that.
Polls have opened across Türkiye on Sunday morning for the country’s presidential and parliamentary elections.
Incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking another term in office, while the opposition candidates are Kemal Kilicdaroglu of Nation’s Alliance and Sinan Ogan of Ata Alliance.
The Supreme Election Board (YSK) announced earlier that more than 64 million citizens are eligible to vote in the elections on 14 May, including more than 3 million voters abroad.
A total of 191,885 ballot boxes have been set up for voters in the country.
The polls will close at 5 pm local time and the first results are expected to start coming in shortly after that.
Voters in Türkiye need to show their identity cards or other official identification documents at polling stations. Then, each voter is given two separate ballot papers, one for the presidential election and one for the parliamentary election. Voters mark their ballot papers in the booth and then place in envelopes.
According to the Turkish electoral body, voters are not allowed to take any photos or videos inside the booth and they leave their mobile phone outside.
After voting ends, the ballots cast for the presidential candidates are counted first in the presence of balloting committee which consists of the members of the Turkish election body and political parties as well as citizens who wish to remain there.
How Türkiye is ensuring security for May 14 pollsSince 1950, when Turkish people started voting in competitive parliamentary elections, electoral participation in Türkiye has remained high, reaching 86 percent in 2018’s presidential and parliamentary elections.
The Turkish electoral body has taken steps to make voting easier for all citizens, regardless of their physical abilities.
For those who are unable to leave their homes or hospital beds, mobile ballot boxes are set up. These boxes are brought to the voter’s location, so they can cast their vote privately.
Alternatively, voters can be transported to ballot boxes with the help of ambulances for free. The electoral body has also provided special voting templates for visually impaired citizens. These templates have large print and Braille, so that visually impaired citizens can vote independently and confidentially.
These initiatives ensure that all citizens can participate in the democratic process with dignity.
Expat votes have been brought to Türkiye by airmail and they will be counted at the same time as the votes cast in Türkiye. Balloting at customs gates began on April 27 and ended on May 9.

27,SC Directs Political Party To Hold Consultation On Election Dates In Punjab And KP And Inform Court Today,https://abbtakk.tv/en/sc-directs-political-party-to-hold-consultation-on-election-dates-in-punjab-and-kp-and-inform-court-today/,"February 28, 2023","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court directed on Tuesday the concerned political parties to hold a consultation on deciding a date for the elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and inform the court by 4pm today.
The directive was passed during the hearing of a suo motu notice taken by the apex court on an apparent delay in elections in the two provinces after the assemblies dissolution, in order to ascertain who had the authority to decide the polls date.
The SC directed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leaders Shireen Mazari and Fawad Chaudhry to consult with party chairman, Imran Khan, and coalition partners’ lawyers to consult with their leaders and update the court by 4pm.
The directive came after the three ruling parties withdrew the plea they had filed for the formation of a full court to hear the suo motu taken up by the Supreme Court on the Punjab and Khyber Pakhutnkhwa elections.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) had jointly filed a plea via Usman Awan, Farooq H Naek, and Kamran Murtaza, respectively, two days after the SC took suo motu notice.
The plea was withdrawn today when the five-member bench headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Shah and Justice Mandokhail resumed hearing of the case today.
Naek, while withdrawing the plea said that the coalition partners have jointly decided not to pursue the plea seeking a full court after the reconstitution of the bench.
At the outset of the hearing, attorney general for Pakistan informed the court that he was ready to give arguments.
He also raised an objection on the Supreme Court Bar Association President Abid Zuberi, saying that his name had been removed from the judicial order.
At this, CJP Bandial said that the court sees the SCBA as an institution.
“What is written in the court is not part of a judicial order. It becomes an order when the judges sign it,” he remarked.
After this, Zuberi started his arguments.
“Supreme Court has declared it in the past that the elections should be held in 90 days,” Zuberi stated.
At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the presidents and governors were bound to follow the Cabinet’s advice as per the Constitution.
“Can the president or governors give the election date on their own,” he inquired.
Meanwhile, CJP Bandial remarked that the governor wasn’t constitutionally bound to follow anyone’s advice regarding the appointment of a caretaker government or deciding the election date.
While, Justice Mazhar added that “no one’s advice is needed where there is discretion.”
Moving on, the CJP asked that who would issue the notification for the assembly dissolution.
Responding to the question, Zuberi said that the notification for the dissolution of Punjab Assembly had been issued by the law secretary.
At this point, Justice Akhtar remarked that the 90-day period starts right after the assembly has been dissolved.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired if the caretaker chief minister could advise the governor on the election date.
To this, Zuberi said that the caretaker setup and the election date is announced simultaneously.
Justice Shah asked whether the governor could reject the caretaker government’s advice?
At this, Zuberi replied that the caretaker setup’s job was to look after government affairs instead of giving a date for the polls, which is the governor’s prerogative.
While referring to the Saifullah case, Zuberi said that the 12-member bench in that case had declared the election process a must.
At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that Article 48 of the Constitution states that every act and step taken by the president would be on the government’s advice.
CJP Bandial seconded Justice Mandokhail’s remark, saying that the deciding a date for the polls would be based on the advice under Article 48.
While, Justice Akhtar remarked that the caretaker setup is appointed after seven days of the assembly’s dissolution.
“Harmony among different clauses of the Constitution is necessary,” he added.
Meanwhile, Justice Mazhar remarked that in Punjab’s case, the ministry of law had issued the notification, not the governor.
Justice Mandokhail said that the government can still tell the governor to conduct elections, as per the Constitution.
Justice Shah wondered how could the governor refuse to conduct elections if he receives the government’s advice regarding the poll date.
Moving on, Zuberi stated that the caretaker setup was established in Punjab on January 22.
“A basic question is that the governor is saying that he didn’t dissolve the assembly,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
Zuberi shared that as per Article 105(3) mentions the process of giving an election date.
Justice Mandokhail said that the government is not bound to give a date for polls.
Zuberi then complained that the date for the polls was not been announced even after so many days.
To this, CJP Bandial asked Zuberi if he was arguing that the government wasn’t fulfilling its constitutional duty.
“Holding elections within 90 days is the spirit of Constitution,” he observed, adding that the court would ask the AGP to assist it on the legal points.
Meanwhile, Zuberi contended that the president would announce a date for the polls if the duration of the assembly ends.
“I contend that fixing the date of polls is the prerogative of the president,” he added.
At this, Justice Mazhar remarked that a 52-day margin would be kept whenever the governor gives the date.
Meanwhile, Justice Mandokhail remarked: “President’s powers have not been stated directly by the Constitution.”
“The action will be taken as per the law if the Constitution doesn’t have the powers,” he said, adding that the laws are based on the Constitution.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired under which law the president was “writing the letters”.
At this, Zuberi said that the president had written the letters for consultations.
To this, the judge replied that the Constitution does not state anywhere about holding consultations.
“If we assume that the law allows the president, even then he is bound to [follow] the advice,” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the caretaker government can also ask for deciding a date.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would decide if the president needed consultation or not, after hearing the other parties in the case.
Zuberi argued that the governor wasn’t bound to follow the advice for announcing the date of election. The same authority as the governor has been given to the president, he added.
“The president either is not bound to [follow] the advice,” Zuberi said while wrapping up his arguments.
Justice Shah remarked that the governor was bound to follow if he was advised to decide an election date.
Elections should be held in 90 days: AGPAfter this, the AGP Shehzad Ata Elahi started his arguments.
“The president can give a date for the election only in case of the dissolution of National Assembly,” he said. He added that the other scenario on which the president can give date for elections is when polls are being conducted countrywide.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the president’s powers to make a decision at discretion and on advice had a difference.
AGP Elahi then argued that that the ECP wouldn’t follow the orders if the governor tells it to hold the election a day after the assembly’s dissolution.
At this, Justice Akhtar remarked that the governor had to keep the Election Act in view as well.
The AGP remarked that the elections should be held in 90 days and the duration shouldn’t be prolonged.
Justice Shah asked if the ECP could delay the election if the date is announced by the governor.
At this, the AGP replied that the electoral body can ask for holding elections in 89 days if the governor orders conducting election on the 85th day after the dissolution of assembly.
On this, CJP Bandial remarked that it was the reason that the governor has been bound to hold consultation with the ECP.
“Whether it is the president or the governor, everyone is bound by the Constitution and law,” he said
To this, Justice Mazhar suggested holding consultation between the governor and ECP and give a date tomorrow.
At this point, the court adjourned the hearing for half an hour.When the hearing reconvened, the AGP continued his arguments and said that the Constitution cannot be interpreted through the parliamentary legislation.
“The Constitution is supreme and it doesn’t allow the president to announce a date of election,” he added.
He said that the Lahore High Court had clearly said that conducting the elections and announcing a date for it was ECP’s authority.
He further stated that the elections was a “subject” for the Centre.
At this, Justice Akhtar said that the ECP has to decide a date for the election and the governor has to announce it.
Justice Mandokhail interjected and wondered if everything was clear then what was the fight about?
Meanwhile, CJP Bandial observed that the hearing of intra-court appeals in the LHC was being adjourned for 14 days. He asked why was such an important constitutional issue was being deferred for long periods.
Moreover, the CJP also inquired under which clause of the Constitution, the ECP has been given the power to decide the poll date.
On this, Justice Mazhar said that the ECP’s authority starts after the announcement of election date, as per the Constitution.
The CJP then remarked that the president had some democratic and some non-democratic powers over the date.
At this, Justice Mazhar asked why don’t they abolish Section 57 if the president is not authorised to give the election date. He asked if anyone had challenged Section 57 for being contradictory to the Constitution.
The judge also asked for the AGP’s opinion that who had the authority to give the date.
ECP has authority to give election date: AGPResponding to the query, AGP Elahi said that the ECP had the authority to give date for the election.
In response to AGP’s comment, Justice Mandokhail said that no consultation was needed if the ECP had to announce the date.
However, Justice Akhtar asked that where would the governor and president’s role go if that was the case.
“Is the president’s role of a news caster that he makes the announcement,” he said, adding that the ECP should use its website if it was just about making an announcement.
At this, the CJP remarked that ECP’s role is important under any circumstances.
“According to you president’s role is central while the other side says it is consultative,” CJP Bandial said while addressing Justice Akhtar.
On this, Justice Akhtar asked if the duration for the election campaign could be shortened.
Responding to the question, ECP’s lawyer maintained that printing process of the ballot papers required time. He, however, said that the duration of election campaign can be shortened up to two weeks.
Justice Akhtar remarked that implementing the constitution was more important.
On this point, AGP Elahi contended that wouldn’t the 1988’s election become controversial if elections have to be conducted in 90 days.
He said that the 2008 polls were also held after the designated period.
At this, CJP reminded the AGP that in 2008 there was a big tragedy. The CJP was referring to the murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
At this, Justice Mandokhail reiterated the question of who will give the date.
“Had the matter of fixing a date been clarified in the law, we wouldn’t be standing at this point today,” he remarked.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would apply Article 254 where it is valid.
Justice Mazhar added that ECP had recommended a date to the governor.
On the other hand, Justice Mandokhail inquired whether the caretaker cabinet can send a summary to the governor.
At this, the AGP replied in negation.
While Justice Mazhar asked how long should the president wait if the prime minister does not send him the advice.
On this point Justice Mandokhail remarked that the Parliament could have made a law and given responsibility to someone.
The AGP told the court that if laws are passed today then the Parliament is mocked that it is incomplete. He also reiterated that the ECP should give the date of polls as the 90 days period close to completion.
“If the dictation on the election date has to come from somewhere else then the ECP can refuse to fulfill other responsibilities as well,” he said while completing his arguments.
The AGP completed his arguments on this point and the ECP’s lawyer started presenting the electoral body’s point of view.
The SC had taken the suo motu notice of an apparent delay in the elections of the two assemblies, on February 23, following President Arif Alvi’s announcement of date of polls, a move that drew strong criticism from the government
As per the CJP, the suo motu notice had been taken to assess who was eligible to issue the date for polls and who had the constitutional responsibility of conducting elections and when.
A nine-member bench was constituted to hear the case but the bench was reconstituted after four judges of the bench recused themselves.
The judges that recused themselves were Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Yahya Afridi.
A written order was also issued on the SC’s website in which dissenting notes of Justice Afridi, Justice Minallah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had been included.
In the previous hearing, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial said that the parliament has clearly written in the Elections Act, 2017, that the president can announce the date for polls.
CJP Bandial had said that the hearing will be wrapped up today.
“Holding elections within 90 days is the spirit of Constitution,” he observed, adding that the court would ask the AGP to assist it on the legal points.
Meanwhile, Zuberi contended that the president would announce a date for the polls if the duration of the assembly ends.
“I contend that fixing the date of polls is the prerogative of the president,” he added.
At this, Justice Mazhar remarked that a 52-day margin would be kept whenever the governor gives the date.
Meanwhile, Justice Mandokhail remarked: “President’s powers have not been stated directly by the Constitution.”
“The action will be taken as per the law if the Constitution doesn’t have the powers,” he said, adding that the laws are based on the Constitution.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired under which law the president was “writing the letters”.
At this, Zuberi said that the president had written the letters for consultations.
To this, the judge replied that the Constitution does not state anywhere about holding consultations.
“If we assume that the law allows the president, even then he is bound to [follow] the advice,” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the caretaker government can also ask for deciding a date.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would decide if the president needed consultation or not, after hearing the other parties in the case.
Zuberi argued that the governor wasn’t bound to follow the advice for announcing the date of election. The same authority as the governor has been given to the president, he added.
“The president either is not bound to [follow] the advice,” Zuberi said while wrapping up his arguments.
Justice Shah remarked that the governor was bound to follow if he was advised to decide an election date.
Elections should be held in 90 days: AGPAfter this, the AGP Shehzad Ata Elahi started his arguments.
“The president can give a date for the election only in case of the dissolution of National Assembly,” he said. He added that the other scenario on which the president can give date for elections is when polls are being conducted countrywide.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the president’s powers to make a decision at discretion and on advice had a difference.
AGP Elahi then argued that that the ECP wouldn’t follow the orders if the governor tells it to hold the election a day after the assembly’s dissolution.
At this, Justice Akhtar remarked that the governor had to keep the Election Act in view as well.
The AGP remarked that the elections should be held in 90 days and the duration shouldn’t be prolonged.
Justice Shah asked if the ECP could delay the election if the date is announced by the governor.
At this, the AGP replied that the electoral body can ask for holding elections in 89 days if the governor orders conducting election on the 85th day after the dissolution of assembly.
On this, CJP Bandial remarked that it was the reason that the governor has been bound to hold consultation with the ECP.
“Whether it is the president or the governor, everyone is bound by the Constitution and law,” he said
To this, Justice Mazhar suggested holding consultation between the governor and ECP and give a date tomorrow.
At this point, the court adjourned the hearing for half an hour.When the hearing reconvened, the AGP continued his arguments and said that the Constitution cannot be interpreted through the parliamentary legislation.
“The Constitution is supreme and it doesn’t allow the president to announce a date of election,” he added.
He said that the Lahore High Court had clearly said that conducting the elections and announcing a date for it was ECP’s authority.
He further stated that the elections was a “subject” for the Centre.
At this, Justice Akhtar said that the ECP has to decide a date for the election and the governor has to announce it.
Justice Mandokhail interjected and wondered if everything was clear then what was the fight about?
Meanwhile, CJP Bandial observed that the hearing of intra-court appeals in the LHC was being adjourned for 14 days. He asked why was such an important constitutional issue was being deferred for long periods.
Moreover, the CJP also inquired under which clause of the Constitution, the ECP has been given the power to decide the poll date.
On this, Justice Mazhar said that the ECP’s authority starts after the announcement of election date, as per the Constitution.
The CJP then remarked that the president had some democratic and some non-democratic powers over the date.
At this, Justice Mazhar asked why don’t they abolish Section 57 if the president is not authorised to give the election date. He asked if anyone had challenged Section 57 for being contradictory to the Constitution.
The judge also asked for the AGP’s opinion that who had the authority to give the date.
ECP has authority to give election date: AGPResponding to the query, AGP Elahi said that the ECP had the authority to give date for the election.
In response to AGP’s comment, Justice Mandokhail said that no consultation was needed if the ECP had to announce the date.
However, Justice Akhtar asked that where would the governor and president’s role go if that was the case.
“Is the president’s role of a news caster that he makes the announcement,” he said, adding that the ECP should use its website if it was just about making an announcement.
At this, the CJP remarked that ECP’s role is important under any circumstances.
“According to you president’s role is central while the other side says it is consultative,” CJP Bandial said while addressing Justice Akhtar.
On this, Justice Akhtar asked if the duration for the election campaign could be shortened.
Responding to the question, ECP’s lawyer maintained that printing process of the ballot papers required time. He, however, said that the duration of election campaign can be shortened up to two weeks.
Justice Akhtar remarked that implementing the constitution was more important.
On this point, AGP Elahi contended that wouldn’t the 1988’s election become controversial if elections have to be conducted in 90 days.
He said that the 2008 polls were also held after the designated period.
At this, CJP reminded the AGP that in 2008 there was a big tragedy. The CJP was referring to the murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
At this, Justice Mandokhail reiterated the question of who will give the date.
“Had the matter of fixing a date been clarified in the law, we wouldn’t be standing at this point today,” he remarked.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would apply Article 254 where it is valid.
Justice Mazhar added that ECP had recommended a date to the governor.
On the other hand, Justice Mandokhail inquired whether the caretaker cabinet can send a summary to the governor.
At this, the AGP replied in negation.
While Justice Mazhar asked how long should the president wait if the prime minister does not send him the advice.
On this point Justice Mandokhail remarked that the Parliament could have made a law and given responsibility to someone.
The AGP told the court that if laws are passed today then the Parliament is mocked that it is incomplete. He also reiterated that the ECP should give the date of polls as the 90 days period close to completion.
“If the dictation on the election date has to come from somewhere else then the ECP can refuse to fulfill other responsibilities as well,” he said while completing his arguments.
The AGP completed his arguments on this point and the ECP’s lawyer started presenting the electoral body’s point of view.
The SC had taken the suo motu notice of an apparent delay in the elections of the two assemblies, on February 23, following President Arif Alvi’s announcement of date of polls, a move that drew strong criticism from the government
As per the CJP, the suo motu notice had been taken to assess who was eligible to issue the date for polls and who had the constitutional responsibility of conducting elections and when.
A nine-member bench was constituted to hear the case but the bench was reconstituted after four judges of the bench recused themselves.
The judges that recused themselves were Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Yahya Afridi.
A written order was also issued on the SC’s website in which dissenting notes of Justice Afridi, Justice Minallah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had been included.
In the previous hearing, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial said that the parliament has clearly written in the Elections Act, 2017, that the president can announce the date for polls.

As per the data shared by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), a total of 17,816 candidates are in the run, including 12,695 for provincial assemblies and 5,121 for National Assembly seats.
They include 16,930 males, 882 females and four transgender persons. The political parties have fielded 6,031 candidates, including 5,726 males and 275 females. A record number of 11,785 independents are also in the race, including 11,174 males, 607 females and four transgender persons.
According to the ECP, the political parties have fielded 1,873 male and 93 female candidates for 266 general seats of the National Assembly with 3,248 independents, including 3,027 males, 2,019 females and two transgender persons in the fray.
Similarly, there are 12,695 candidates for 593 provincial assembly constituencies, including 12,123 males, 570 women and two transgender persons.
Women form 46% (59.3 million) and men 54% (69.2 million) of the total registered voters. However, more than 56 million young voters between the age brackets of 18-25 and 26-35 years are being seen as potential factor in shaping the legislatures.
The cliffhanger electoral contest will feature 28.74 million voters in the age group of 36 to 45 years.
Those on the premises of a polling station would be allowed to exercise their right to vote after the time is over. The voters will elect the National Assembly members who will then by majority vote choose the next prime minister.
Likewise, the voters will also elect lawmakers to their respective four provincial assemblies, who will then elect the chief ministers.
Over 260 million ballots — half of them green and half white — have already been printed and delivered to the presiding officers by road and air to over 90,000 polling stations under a security cover provided by the police and other law-enforcement agencies.
Security plan
To ensure the security of voters and polling staff, 648,000 security personnel have been deployed for poll duties, including 137,000 military and 511,000 police personnel. The commission has already issued the election code of conduct.
As many as 90,675 polling stations have been established across the country, out of which more than half have been declared as sensitive or most sensitive.
The army will serve as the third layer of security in Quick Response Force mode; however, two army personnel each will be deployed outside over 18,000 highly sensitive polling stations. Their entry in the polling stations will depend on the requirement of presiding officers.
During the last over five years, for the first time a prime minister had to go home after a no-trust motion. Some prominent politicians, including Imran Khan, Ch Shujaat Hussain, Asfandyar Wali and Shah Mehmood Qureshi, are not contesting owing to different reasons.
Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif is back from abroad and is looking for his fourth term as the country’s chief executive.
Speculations are rife that in view of the prevailing political and electoral situation, no political party in the Centre may be able to form the government and hence a coalition setup is being predicted after the elections.
Besides the youth, independents are expected to mainly decide the shape of legislatures.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also fielded its candidates as independents. Their alignment, which according to rules, has to be made within three days after the publication of returned candidates, will be crucial and major political stakeholders will be trying to lure them for support. Of the total 336 members, 169 members can form a simple majority government.
Owing to the death of contesting candidates, election proceedings have already been terminated in four national and provincial assembly constituencies. These are NA-8 Bajaur, PK-22 Bajaur, PK-91 Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and PP-266 Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab.
In a related development, the Election Commission has taken notice of continuous running of political advertisements, statements and texts on electronic media and has directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to hold all such channels accountable and ensure adherence to Section 182 of the Elections Act 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media.
The commission has reminded Pemra that under Section 182 of the Elections Act, 2017 and the commission’s Code of Conduct for National Media, after 12 midnight on February 6, there is a ban on the election campaign, advertisements and other written material on electronic and print media and strict action should be taken against the channels violating this ban.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission spokesman has said the commission has suspended an officer of the Information Group Pir Suleman Shah Rashdi for violation of the code of conduct and misconduct by issuing a video message for support of a particular political party’s candidates. However, he added the officer will be able to draw his salary, allowances and other benefits during his suspension.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has announced that the internet service would continue uninterrupted countrywide. In a statement, the Authority said there won’t be an internet shutdown on the Election Day.

3,Pakistan Election 2024: Can ECP handle tsunami of tech-powered propaganda?,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-election-2024-can-ecp-handle-tsunami-of-tech-powered-propaganda/,"February 8, 2024","The 2024 polls will differ significantly from previous ones, with over 128 million voters, comprising more than half of the population, and witnessing an additional 42.3 million individuals added to the electoral roll since the 2013 polls.
In the upcoming polls scheduled for February 8, the youth will be a deciding factor, as voters under the age of 35 constitute 44% of the total electorate. Whichever political party can convince this age group stands to win elections easily, because this demographic eats, drinks, and sleeps internet.
In 2018, during the last polls, the country had over 44 million social media users, making the use of new media technology more significant in political communication than ever before.
While the 2013 polls are considered the country’s first social media elections, the 2024 ones are the biggest ever in terms of technology use, with 87.35 million internet users in January 2023.
Moreover, Pakistan is home to 71.70 million social media users, constituting 30% of the total population, bringing about a significant change in political communication.
However, this scenario has its pros, but it also comes with its cons. While technology has boosted campaigning, it has also given rise to serious misgivings as this picture also has a darker side, which harbours active dissemination of disinformation and fake news. Given these real-time concerns, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has, for the first time, included digital media in its code of conduct for the 2024 polls.
The commission, in its notification, specifically mentions terms like social media influencers, digital media, and verified social media accounts, indicating its readiness for this new challenge.
“During the election campaign, the content floated on print, electronic and digital media, shall not reflect any opinion prejudicial to the ideology, sovereignty, dignity or security of Pakistan, public order or the integrity and independence of the judiciary of Pakistan and other national institutions,” the ECP state in its notification.
Despite the challenges of the new information system, political parties have adapted to new methods, from constituency-wise WhatsApp channels to TikTok jalsas (public meetings), in efforts to woo the younger generation. This has compelled government authorities to come up with new policies and monitoring tools.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party of former prime minister Imran Khan, has been highly innovative in the use of advanced technologies, changing the way campaigning is done in Pakistan.
With the use of artificial intelligence, the launching of a dedicated portal for candidates, and the introduction of a Facebook bot, the PTI has been leading the charge. However, the credit for these creativities could easily be given to a myriad of gags imposed on the party by the state.
In this regard, the Election Commission has updated its policies, incorporating several new topics to cover different aspects of social media. However, some aspects lack clarity, leaving room for manipulation. For instance, the ECP didn’t explain how it would determine “official accounts” on social media, as it is now convenient for anyone to get an account verified on X by making a payment.
Moreover, there’s a need for clarity on social media spending by political parties and candidates, as well as virtual canvassing and campaigning, as per Sections 177 and 182 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Experts have urged the commission to enforce these policies rigorously, as other government bodies are tasked to assist in carrying out its functions. State institutions, such as the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Press Information Department (PID) Cyber Wing, and Digital Media Wing of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB), are responsible for monitoring coverage.
Sharing her concerns, AbbTakk Factcheck Editor Benazir Shah said: “I don’t think that the ECP is going to be able to or has the required facilities and the resources to monitor social media”.
Considering the ever-expanding social media landscape riddled with various fast-mutating platforms, Shah pointed out a disruptive change. She said the brands were increasingly flocking to TikTok for their campaigns, making the most of its extensive outreach. She added that as the AI-generated visuals were all the rage these days, social media marketing had never been better.
“I don’t think the ECP has the resources. The last time that I got an estimate from ECP they said they had around 4,000 to 5,000 employees. And not only that, you need a dedicated wing of people who specialise in monitoring social media and who know how to keep a track of it and also be able to do it around the clock.”
Shah highlighted that she hadn’t read anywhere that the ECP had set up any kind of a wing that is dedicated to monitoring the digital media and the election campaigns on it.
“So, until and unless that happens, I think this is just a mere formality that they’re fulfilling.”
Echoing the concerns, Digital Rights Foundation chief Nighat Dad, in an opinion piece for The News, wrote that while the ECP has laid down a framework for campaign expenditures it doesn’t clearly mention whether it applies strictly to physical campaigning. Hence, it can be argued that the broader application of law can cover both offline and online campaign financing.
“Thousands of political ads run on social media during the days leading up to elections in Pakistan, especially on Facebook and YouTube. The regulation of online and social media campaign financing is a relatively new and evolving area, and, unfortunately, the ECP’s policies are silent on accountability around digital political ads,” she stated.
Dad shared that countries like the US have developed measures in this regard and are enforced strictly, adding platforms have their own policies which include background checks and transparency requirements.
“A pressing question is: how much can candidates and their supporters spend on online political campaigns in Pakistan? The lack of explicit regulations by the ECP on online political advertising leaves a significant area of campaign financing unregulated. This gap allows for the potential misuse of online platforms for electioneering without adequate oversight or accountability,” she further added.

10,Erdogan exposes west saying its leaders cannot even call on Israel for ceasefire,https://abbtakk.tv/en/erdogan-exposes-saying-western-leaders-cannot-even-call-on-israel-for-a-ceasefire-let-alone-react-to-it/,"October 29, 2023","ISTANBUL: President Tayyip Erdogan addressed hundreds of thousands of supporters at one of the largest pro-Palestinian rallies since the Israel-Hamas war began, courting his political base a day ahead of the centenary of Turkey’s secular republic.
“Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it,” Erdogan told the crowd in Istanbul, who waved Palestinian flags.
“We will tell the whole world that Israel is a war criminal. We are making preparations for this. We will declare Israel a war criminal,” he said.
In an hour-long speech, Erdogan also repeated his assertion that Hamas was not a terrorist organisation, describing Israel as an occupier.
Turkey has condemned Israeli civilian deaths caused by Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,400, but Erdogan this week called the group Palestinian “freedom fighters”.
He also criticised some Western nations’ unconditional support for Israel, drawing sharp rebukes from Italy and Israel.
Unlike many NATO allies, the European Union, and some Gulf states, Turkey does not consider Hamas a “terrorist” organisation. It has long hosted its members, supports a two-state solution, and has offered to play a role in negotiating the release of hostages abducted by Hamas during the October 7 assault.
Political analysts said Erdogan was keen to reinforce his criticism of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip and to overshadow Sunday’s celebrations marking Turkey’s secular roots.
Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and director of the Centre for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, an Istanbul-based think-tank, said Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis and pressure from political allies had prompted Erdogan to sharpen his rhetoric.
Turkey “will protect its principles and share these with the international community, but it needs to do this with a more delicate diplomacy if it expects to play such a diplomatic role,” Ulgen said.
The heads of allied nationalist and religious parties — which helped Erdogan secure victory in tight May elections — attended the rally at Istanbul’s old airport. Erdogan criticised opposition parties for not calling Netanyahu a “terrorist” and for using the same term with reference to Hamas.
Ataturk legacyErdogan had invited all Turks to attend the rally where he said “only our flag and the Palestine flag will wave”. His AK Party had predicted more than a million people would come.
Modern Turkey’s 100th anniversary comes on Sunday when newspaper headlines could be dominated by news of the Saturday rally rather than celebrations of the republic’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, analysts say.
Erdogan, Turkey’s longest-serving leader, and his AK Party have eroded support for the Western-facing ideals of Ataturk. In recent years, Erdogan’s portraits have appeared alongside those of Ataturk on government buildings and schools.
“The symbolism is clear and no one in Turkey is unaware of it — that the pro-Palestinian rally is likely to overshadow celebrations for the centennial of the secular republic,” said Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.
She said that while Erdogan’s comments about Hamas reflected Ankara’s long-held position, he aimed to benefit from anti-Israel sentiment domestically and “consolidate Turkey’s Sunni conservatives”.
The government has said the Israel-Hamas conflict will not restrict celebrations of the 100th anniversary, for which it has organised events across the country.

11,Caretaker PM rules out possibility of any delay in general elections,https://abbtakk.tv/en/caretaker-pm-rules-out-possibility-of-any-delay-in-general-elections/,"October 12, 2023","ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Thursday dismissed the impression that the decision of Pakistan Muslim League leader Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan was part of any deal with the interim government. “The caretaker government has ‘no soft corner’ for PML-N or any other political party…How can a caretaker government strike such a deal,” he said in an interview with digital media platform, WE (World Echo) News.
The prime minister was responding to a question relating to the PML-N chief’s homecoming who flew from London to Saudi Arabia yesterday with his announcement to land in Pakistan on October 21. Kakar pointed out that Nawaz Sharif left the country as per the court decision “under the nose of Imran Khan’s government, and not the caretaker setup”. However, he said that if Nawaz Sharif returns and takes part in politics, he will have to face some legal obstacles. “The answers to these legal questions lie in legal remedies,” he said.
Kakar said any leader be it Imran Khan, Asif Ali Zardari, or Nawaz Sharif, everyone would have to seek their legal remedy as per their case scenario.
He said Pakistan was facing the formation of “regimental camps” and the country had been turned into a fighting ground for political positions. He rejected the notion that the caretaker setup could be likened to the 90s ‘Kakar formula’ where both Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan were forced to quit on the proposal of then army chief General Waheed Kakar to make way for fresh election. “This comparison is apples and oranges. It is out of context because in our case, the stint of the normal parliament led to its retirement and we are part of the constitutional continuation where leaders of the House and the Opposition agreed upon my name,” he said.
There has been no interference from any institution in our case, he said.
On general polls, he said necessary security and administrative arrangements were in place. He said the caretaker government in collaboration with the Election Commission was in the process of the finalization of the required measures.
Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar has ruled out the possibility of any delay in general elections.
In an interview with a private television channel, he said the polls would be announced and conducted on time and there is no possibility of delay in the elections.
Reiterating the caretaker government’s resolve to hold free and fair elections, the Prime Minister said all registered political parties have legal and constitutional rights to canvass, mobilize people and attract public support.
On the expulsion of Afghan refugees, the prime minister said the action was being taken only against unregistered foreign nationals and over one million illegal aliens. The government’s objective, he said, was to regulate the movement of unregistered foreign nationals through proper process.
On relations with India, he said the radicalized RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) mindset of the ruling Indian party and the Kashmir dispute were the main hurdles in the maintenance of good ties. “The situation between Pakistan and India needs to be improved, however, realistically at present, there is no such possibility,” he said.
PM Kakar said the hegemonic designs of India needed to be curtailed as the country was turning into hell for its minorities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and others.
Asked about any possibility of recognition of Israel, he said, “There are no such deliberations going on.” Pakistan considers Israel an “oppressor” and stands with the rights of Palestinians to their existence and return to their land, he said.
On Pakistan’s economic stability, he said the country for the first time witnessed a reversal of the value of the dollar with a consistent descent of about Rs 40-45.
He said the continuation of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SFIC) would lead to sustainability. He dismissed the impression that the army had taken over the mining sector on the SFIC platform. “The army’s role is a stop-gap arrangement to run the matters and at SFIC, it is providing impetus in the facilitation process,” he said.
He emphasized the need for capacity-building of civil institutions as a pathway for a viable state economically.
In Balochistan, he termed security, governance, scarcity of resources, and mismanagement as the main challenges. He recalled that during the meeting of the apex committee held in Quetta, it was revealed that hundreds of ghost schools and health units existed in the province. “Such mismanagement has led to making a few billionaires but leaving the rest of the population deprived including the common Balochs, Pashtuns, and Hazaras,” he said.

Addressing a news conference alongside Governor Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori, the minister assured impartial treatment to any political group during the election campaign.

Solangi said the caretaker government’s tenure was extended a little bit due to the approval of fresh census results by the Council of Common Interest.
He pointed to Article 51 (5) of the Constitution, stating that elections would be held in line with the recently approved census after delimitation of the constituencies.
The minister disclosed that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was actively engaged in the delimitation process and announced that preliminary results of the process would be announced on November 27, with the final results set for release on November 30.
In accordance with the Election Act, he said the ECP would have to give 54 days to political parties for their election campaign.
Solangi welcomed the announcement by the ECP that elections would take place in the first week of January, which ended propaganda against the caretaker government.
As regards the criticisms of Fawad Hassan Fawad, who served in the civil service for over 35 years, the minister highlighted that Fawad had worked with various governments.
He stressed that civil servants had no power over choosing their assignments, and that unfounded criticism of someone who had been unjustly imprisoned was unfair.
Solangi also clarified that Fawad Hassan Fawad had no political affiliations. Responding to a query, the minister expressed his commitment to pursuing justice in the Jan Muhammad Mahar murder case, noting that he had personally raised the matter with the interim chief minister of Sindh.
Solangi said the caretaker government had nothing to do with Nawaz Sharif’s matter, adding his cases were in the court, and it was inappropriate to speculate on the issue.
He stressed that all citizens in the country were entitled to their fundamental rights, highlighting the importance of student organizations as a pillar of democracy.
The minister underscored the role of the independent and empowered Election Commission in ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections, with the caretaker government requiring ECP approval for transfer postings.
Solangi said government was actively working to address the issues of workers in newspapers and TV channels.
He confirmed the lawful arrest of journalist Khalid Jamil by the FIA and emphasized adherence to constitutional and legal procedures, including producing individuals before the court within 24 hours.
Solangi said the caretaker government would not interfere in judicial matters.
To another query, he said the institutions were functioning freely and if anybody had any issue, they could reach out the relevant forums.

In the meeting, they discussed important issues including conducting free, fair, and transparent elections and providing facilities to the media during the election process.
The minister said that conducting free, fair, and transparent elections was the common responsibility of the relevant institutions.
He said that media was part and parcel of various stages of the election process as it acted as a bridge for the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Authentic reporting in elections was most important to ensure access to accurate information to the public, Solangi maintained.
Both leaders reiterated their determination to fully cooperate in conducting the elections in a free and transparent manner.

Our endeavour is to take the country from its current state to a better one,” the minister remarked.

27,SC Directs Political Party To Hold Consultation On Election Dates In Punjab And KP And Inform Court Today,https://abbtakk.tv/en/sc-directs-political-party-to-hold-consultation-on-election-dates-in-punjab-and-kp-and-inform-court-today/,"February 28, 2023","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court directed on Tuesday the concerned political parties to hold a consultation on deciding a date for the elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and inform the court by 4pm today.
The directive was passed during the hearing of a suo motu notice taken by the apex court on an apparent delay in elections in the two provinces after the assemblies dissolution, in order to ascertain who had the authority to decide the polls date.
The SC directed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leaders Shireen Mazari and Fawad Chaudhry to consult with party chairman, Imran Khan, and coalition partners’ lawyers to consult with their leaders and update the court by 4pm.
The directive came after the three ruling parties withdrew the plea they had filed for the formation of a full court to hear the suo motu taken up by the Supreme Court on the Punjab and Khyber Pakhutnkhwa elections.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) had jointly filed a plea via Usman Awan, Farooq H Naek, and Kamran Murtaza, respectively, two days after the SC took suo motu notice.
The plea was withdrawn today when the five-member bench headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Shah and Justice Mandokhail resumed hearing of the case today.
Naek, while withdrawing the plea said that the coalition partners have jointly decided not to pursue the plea seeking a full court after the reconstitution of the bench.
At the outset of the hearing, attorney general for Pakistan informed the court that he was ready to give arguments.
He also raised an objection on the Supreme Court Bar Association President Abid Zuberi, saying that his name had been removed from the judicial order.
At this, CJP Bandial said that the court sees the SCBA as an institution.
“What is written in the court is not part of a judicial order. It becomes an order when the judges sign it,” he remarked.
After this, Zuberi started his arguments.
“Supreme Court has declared it in the past that the elections should be held in 90 days,” Zuberi stated.
At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the presidents and governors were bound to follow the Cabinet’s advice as per the Constitution.
“Can the president or governors give the election date on their own,” he inquired.
Meanwhile, CJP Bandial remarked that the governor wasn’t constitutionally bound to follow anyone’s advice regarding the appointment of a caretaker government or deciding the election date.
While, Justice Mazhar added that “no one’s advice is needed where there is discretion.”
Moving on, the CJP asked that who would issue the notification for the assembly dissolution.
Responding to the question, Zuberi said that the notification for the dissolution of Punjab Assembly had been issued by the law secretary.
At this point, Justice Akhtar remarked that the 90-day period starts right after the assembly has been dissolved.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired if the caretaker chief minister could advise the governor on the election date.
To this, Zuberi said that the caretaker setup and the election date is announced simultaneously.
Justice Shah asked whether the governor could reject the caretaker government’s advice?
At this, Zuberi replied that the caretaker setup’s job was to look after government affairs instead of giving a date for the polls, which is the governor’s prerogative.
While referring to the Saifullah case, Zuberi said that the 12-member bench in that case had declared the election process a must.
At this, Justice Mandokhail remarked that Article 48 of the Constitution states that every act and step taken by the president would be on the government’s advice.
CJP Bandial seconded Justice Mandokhail’s remark, saying that the deciding a date for the polls would be based on the advice under Article 48.
While, Justice Akhtar remarked that the caretaker setup is appointed after seven days of the assembly’s dissolution.
“Harmony among different clauses of the Constitution is necessary,” he added.
Meanwhile, Justice Mazhar remarked that in Punjab’s case, the ministry of law had issued the notification, not the governor.
Justice Mandokhail said that the government can still tell the governor to conduct elections, as per the Constitution.
Justice Shah wondered how could the governor refuse to conduct elections if he receives the government’s advice regarding the poll date.
Moving on, Zuberi stated that the caretaker setup was established in Punjab on January 22.
“A basic question is that the governor is saying that he didn’t dissolve the assembly,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
Zuberi shared that as per Article 105(3) mentions the process of giving an election date.
Justice Mandokhail said that the government is not bound to give a date for polls.
Zuberi then complained that the date for the polls was not been announced even after so many days.
To this, CJP Bandial asked Zuberi if he was arguing that the government wasn’t fulfilling its constitutional duty.
“Holding elections within 90 days is the spirit of Constitution,” he observed, adding that the court would ask the AGP to assist it on the legal points.
Meanwhile, Zuberi contended that the president would announce a date for the polls if the duration of the assembly ends.
“I contend that fixing the date of polls is the prerogative of the president,” he added.
At this, Justice Mazhar remarked that a 52-day margin would be kept whenever the governor gives the date.
Meanwhile, Justice Mandokhail remarked: “President’s powers have not been stated directly by the Constitution.”
“The action will be taken as per the law if the Constitution doesn’t have the powers,” he said, adding that the laws are based on the Constitution.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah inquired under which law the president was “writing the letters”.
At this, Zuberi said that the president had written the letters for consultations.
To this, the judge replied that the Constitution does not state anywhere about holding consultations.
“If we assume that the law allows the president, even then he is bound to [follow] the advice,” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah said that the caretaker government can also ask for deciding a date.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would decide if the president needed consultation or not, after hearing the other parties in the case.
Zuberi argued that the governor wasn’t bound to follow the advice for announcing the date of election. The same authority as the governor has been given to the president, he added.
“The president either is not bound to [follow] the advice,” Zuberi said while wrapping up his arguments.
Justice Shah remarked that the governor was bound to follow if he was advised to decide an election date.
Elections should be held in 90 days: AGPAfter this, the AGP Shehzad Ata Elahi started his arguments.
“The president can give a date for the election only in case of the dissolution of National Assembly,” he said. He added that the other scenario on which the president can give date for elections is when polls are being conducted countrywide.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the president’s powers to make a decision at discretion and on advice had a difference.
AGP Elahi then argued that that the ECP wouldn’t follow the orders if the governor tells it to hold the election a day after the assembly’s dissolution.
At this, Justice Akhtar remarked that the governor had to keep the Election Act in view as well.
The AGP remarked that the elections should be held in 90 days and the duration shouldn’t be prolonged.
Justice Shah asked if the ECP could delay the election if the date is announced by the governor.
At this, the AGP replied that the electoral body can ask for holding elections in 89 days if the governor orders conducting election on the 85th day after the dissolution of assembly.
On this, CJP Bandial remarked that it was the reason that the governor has been bound to hold consultation with the ECP.
“Whether it is the president or the governor, everyone is bound by the Constitution and law,” he said
To this, Justice Mazhar suggested holding consultation between the governor and ECP and give a date tomorrow.
At this point, the court adjourned the hearing for half an hour.When the hearing reconvened, the AGP continued his arguments and said that the Constitution cannot be interpreted through the parliamentary legislation.
“The Constitution is supreme and it doesn’t allow the president to announce a date of election,” he added.
He said that the Lahore High Court had clearly said that conducting the elections and announcing a date for it was ECP’s authority.
He further stated that the elections was a “subject” for the Centre.
At this, Justice Akhtar said that the ECP has to decide a date for the election and the governor has to announce it.
Justice Mandokhail interjected and wondered if everything was clear then what was the fight about?
Meanwhile, CJP Bandial observed that the hearing of intra-court appeals in the LHC was being adjourned for 14 days. He asked why was such an important constitutional issue was being deferred for long periods.
Moreover, the CJP also inquired under which clause of the Constitution, the ECP has been given the power to decide the poll date.
On this, Justice Mazhar said that the ECP’s authority starts after the announcement of election date, as per the Constitution.
The CJP then remarked that the president had some democratic and some non-democratic powers over the date.
At this, Justice Mazhar asked why don’t they abolish Section 57 if the president is not authorised to give the election date. He asked if anyone had challenged Section 57 for being contradictory to the Constitution.
The judge also asked for the AGP’s opinion that who had the authority to give the date.
ECP has authority to give election date: AGPResponding to the query, AGP Elahi said that the ECP had the authority to give date for the election.
In response to AGP’s comment, Justice Mandokhail said that no consultation was needed if the ECP had to announce the date.
However, Justice Akhtar asked that where would the governor and president’s role go if that was the case.
“Is the president’s role of a news caster that he makes the announcement,” he said, adding that the ECP should use its website if it was just about making an announcement.
At this, the CJP remarked that ECP’s role is important under any circumstances.
“According to you president’s role is central while the other side says it is consultative,” CJP Bandial said while addressing Justice Akhtar.
On this, Justice Akhtar asked if the duration for the election campaign could be shortened.
Responding to the question, ECP’s lawyer maintained that printing process of the ballot papers required time. He, however, said that the duration of election campaign can be shortened up to two weeks.
Justice Akhtar remarked that implementing the constitution was more important.
On this point, AGP Elahi contended that wouldn’t the 1988’s election become controversial if elections have to be conducted in 90 days.
He said that the 2008 polls were also held after the designated period.
At this, CJP reminded the AGP that in 2008 there was a big tragedy. The CJP was referring to the murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
At this, Justice Mandokhail reiterated the question of who will give the date.
“Had the matter of fixing a date been clarified in the law, we wouldn’t be standing at this point today,” he remarked.
At this, CJP Bandial remarked that the court would apply Article 254 where it is valid.
Justice Mazhar added that ECP had recommended a date to the governor.
On the other hand, Justice Mandokhail inquired whether the caretaker cabinet can send a summary to the governor.
At this, the AGP replied in negation.
While Justice Mazhar asked how long should the president wait if the prime minister does not send him the advice.
On this point Justice Mandokhail remarked that the Parliament could have made a law and given responsibility to someone.
The AGP told the court that if laws are passed today then the Parliament is mocked that it is incomplete. He also reiterated that the ECP should give the date of polls as the 90 days period close to completion.
“If the dictation on the election date has to come from somewhere else then the ECP can refuse to fulfill other responsibilities as well,” he said while completing his arguments.
The AGP completed his arguments on this point and the ECP’s lawyer started presenting the electoral body’s point of view.
The SC had taken the suo motu notice of an apparent delay in the elections of the two assemblies, on February 23, following President Arif Alvi’s announcement of date of polls, a move that drew strong criticism from the government

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, the Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said, the PML-N was ready to deal with any political situation. The interior minister said that the next elections in Punjab would clear all doubts of Imran Khan.
The Minister said “We want assemblies to complete their constitutional tenure as we believe in democracy.”
Rana Sanaullah said that Imran Khan tried his best in the last seven months to create instability in the country and
To a question, he said that general election would be held on time, but if assemblies of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab were dissolved, election would be held in 90 days.
He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had talked about charter of economy in the larger interest of the country, but the PTI chief had never taken it seriously. He said when Imran Khan was levelling baseless corruption allegations against PML-N leadership, he himself was also committing corruption at that time.
To a query, he said that FIRs [first information reports] against Azam Swati and Shahbaz Gill were not registered on political basis.To another question, he said if Suleman Shehbaz extended his support to the PML-N in politics, it would be a good addition for the party. Uzma Bokhari was also present along with the Minister.
Rana Sanaullah has demanded Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and Shahzad Akbar to apologise to the nation for using negative tactics to facilitate the British newspaper, Daily Mail, for publishing an article against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
He said that negative tactics were used to harm the Sharif family’s repute. He also called upon people to recognise such faces which go to any extent for their vested interests, adding that the PTI chairman caused an irreparable loss to the country through his actions.
Rana Sanaullah said that negative propaganda was created over money-laundering issue, but no charges were proven against any member of the Sharif family.

“Both the parties foresee their defeat in the AJK upcoming elections as they not only failed to field strong candidates, but also lack popular support there,” he said in a televised news conference.
He said both the parties had faced the ‘worst-ever’ defeat in the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) elections for making ‘false’ claims, and the outcome of AJK polls would also not be different.
The minister said the Federal Government allocated record funds for the GB in the Public Sector Development Programme 2021-22 after the area people gave heavy mandate to the PTI at the hustings.
Similarly, he said, the AJK would also have a PTI man as prime minister, eventually marking a new era of development with creation of massive job opportunities and improved infrastructure.

48,Nawaz Sharif Has Given Responsibility Of AJK Election To Me: Maryam Nawaz,https://abbtakk.tv/en/nawaz-sharif-has-given-responsibility-of-ajk-election-to-me-maryam-nawaz/,"July 6, 2021","ISLAMABAD:Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice-president Maryam Nawaz said the “PML-N is in the strongest position in AJK, and if free and fair polls are held, then our party will win the election with overwhelming majority.”
She made this statement in response to a question during a media talk outside the Islamabad High Court.
She added that people had lost trust in the current system in view of “blatant rigging in the past elections”.
She took a jibe at Prime Minister Imran Khan for trying to redress grievances of angry Baloch and said the premier should first visit the often-targetted Hazara community.
Addressing a gathering in Gwadar a day earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan said he is mulling to hold talks with angry Baloch so that hostile elements, including India, could not use them to spread chaos.
“Balochs are as much Pakistani as you and I and [we should strive to] keep them bonded with the country. Their reservations should be addressed,” Maryam remarked.
She went on to add that the premier should have visited the Hazara community first before talking about taking the Baloch dissidents onboard.
“They were calling for you but you had said at the time that you wouldn’t be blackmailed by bodies,” she said while referring to an earlier protest by the community against the killing of their community members.
When asked about the government’s alleged backdoor contacts with Israel, she believed the government had recognised Israel as “it is not even issuing a denial” to reports and statements from news agencies emphasising on Pakistan’s reported acceptance of the Jewish nation-state.
Maryam stressed the government should apprise the nation of its decision [on Israel]. “It’s not your personal decision… it’s something that is linked to 220 million people of Pakistan.”
She further stated that foreign policy should not be viewed in light of the domestic political situation.”You should first pay attention to [setting your] own home [in order]. [The rulers] shouldn’t lie to the people or deceive them,” she maintained.
The PML-N leader ruled out any deal with the establishment. “People bring up a ‘deal’ all the time,” she said and added, “Why would there be a deal and with whom.”
“We aren’t insane to strike a deal after waging such a struggle. We’ll get to terms with it when things settle down.”
Maryam warned that any rigging in the forthcoming elections in Azad Jammu & Kashmir will have a far-reaching impact.
“The results of rigging in the polls will not be good. Don’t try to steal the elections,” she said and added, “You get defeated even after abducting the polling staff.”
She further said, “Don’t come in the way of the people and their elected representatives.
“The PML-N leader expressed confidence that her party would win the polls if they will be held transparently and independently.
To a question regarding her absence from Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) recently held rally in Swat, she said, “There are no differences within PML-N. Nawaz Sharif has tasked me with [mobilising the party] for the AJK polls, so Shehbaz Sharif represented me in Swat’s gathering.”
“Shehbaz Sharif is my president and of PML-N’s; his presence suffices for us too,” she added.

Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhary Fawad Hussain and Adviser on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan shared details of the reforms agenda at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday.
Babar Awan said the reforms agenda envisages a series of amendments to the constitution and the Election Act 2017. He said reforms agenda will be put forth before the stakeholders including the civil society, the media and bar councils and associations for their inputs.
Under the reforms package, the Adviser on Parliamentary Affairs said section 103 is being amended to allow the use of electronic voting machines to check rigging in the elections.
He said section 94 will be amended to give the right of franchise to the overseas Pakistanis.
The Adviser on Parliamentary Affairs stressed that there should also be democracy within the political parties. Therefore, it has been decided to bring an amendment in section 202 under which the political parties having representation of ten thousand members will be able to get themselves registered. A new section of 213A is also being introduced making it compulsory on the political parties to hold their annual conventions. An amendment in section 15 will provide an opportunity to the candidates to challenge the polling staff.
Babar Awan said it is also being proposed that the electoral rolls be prepared on the basis of registration data available with the NADRA. He said we also want the delimitation of constituencies on the basis of registered voters.
The Adviser on parliamentary affairs said two constitutional amendments will also be brought with the aim to ensure open ballot in the Senate and allow the overseas Pakistanis to contest the elections.
Babar Awan said that our reforms agenda also envisages the proposal of further empowering the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhary Fawad Hussain said the government wants to get the reforms agenda passed from the parliament through consensus. He said if the opposition parties are not ready for the reforms, it will impede the process of political and democratic development.
The Information Minister said it is the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan that the political parties sit together to carry out the electoral reforms. He said the reforms will enhance the confidence of the people, political parties and intelligentsia on the election process. He defended the use of electronic voting machines in the election saying it will ensure early results.

The PPP Chairman and the Vice-President of PML-N addressed the news conference after their meet-up at Jati Umra.
PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz lashed out at PM Imran Khan on Thursday, claiming that his support was dwindling within the PTI.
Maryam spoke highly of the PDM’s joint candidate from Islamabad, former prime minister Gillani. “Yousaf Raza Gillani is not only the PDM’s candidate but he has an affable personality,” she said, adding that the PML-N fully backs him as its joint candidate for the Senate seat.
“I hope every pro-democracy person will not vote for the PTI [in the Senate elections] because we think the PTI is guilty of crimes against the people and Imran Khan is guilty of crimes against the nation,” added Maryam.
The PPP chairperson said that the government had suffered defeats in the recent by-elections, from Pishin to Sialkot. “The people have rejected them in every by-election,” he said. “I believe two decisions taken by the PDM — one to contest the by-elections and the other to partake in the Senate polls — have completely changed the political situation and has made the government anxious,” added Bilawal.
“We [PDM] took the decisions to contest the by-elections and the Senate elections together. When it comes to sending this government home, we will also decide as to when we will do that, through consensus,” he added.
In response to a question, the PPP chairperson said that the PDM was contesting an election and its constituency was the parliament.
“Yes, we are in contact with every member of the parliament and are trying to get them to vote for our candidates,” he said.
Bilawal said that the PDM believed in the Constitution and in the principal that each democratic government should complete its constitutional tenure. However, he said that the current system was an unjust one where political allies of the incumbent government were “tied together” to it by force.
The PPP leader condemned the arrest of Khursheed Shah and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Shehbaz Sharif.
Earlier, PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the PML-N vice president had met to discuss political developments as the Senate elections loom near and the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) gears up to give the government a tough time in the polls.

He said the opposition also suggested that corruption cases of less than one billion rupees, willful default or writing off loan, and offence of money laundering should stay out of NAB’s purview.
The Minister said another proposal is to change the definition of Benamidars, giving free hands to make corruption in the name of wife and children. It was proposed to allow convicts to contest elections till final disposal of their cases and disqualification should be up to only five years.

Dozens marched through streets in Los Angeles and crowds of 200 or more were in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Portland, Oregon. Minnesota saw more than a dozen arrests.
Tempers flared as the evening wore on, with President Trump perhaps adding fuel to the fire by making a statement that he thinks the election is rigged. He made the comment while Biden held a slight lede in the race but with several key states remaining to be counted.
“This is fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country . .. . Frankly, we did win the election,” Trump said. It’s unclear whether his comment caused protests to escalate.
Other reports of confrontation surfaced Tuesday. A man wearing a shirt supporting incumbent President Donald Trump challenged a protester to a fight in a situation that was diffused by police, according to the New York Times.
The outlet also reported a man was hit with a bat after he shouted “all lives matter” and a protester who was chanting “Black lives matter.” Bystanders broke up that confrontation, The New York Times reported.
A D.C. Metropolitan Police Department spokesman said so far, one arrest had been made as of just before 10 p.m. An adult male was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, crossing a police line and resisting arrest.
Shortly before midnight, dozens of black-clad protesters began marching west from Black Lives Matter Plaza, using megaphones to chant: “Black lives matter!” A handful of fireworks went off as they marched.
Bloomberg reported the protesters unfurled a large black banner with the words “Remove Trump” in white all-caps letters.
The Los Angeles Police Department early Tuesday had called a “citywide tactical alert” to ensure enough officers are on hand to address any incidents on Election Day.” Shortly after 8 p.m. local time, the department announced it was attempting to disperse a “large and unruly crowd.”
Several dozen protesters faced off against officers in riot gear. They had been among about 100 demonstrators who marched Pershing Square, then to Staples Center to a light-rail station a few blocks away where officers formed a skirmish line. Several arrests were reported.
In Chicago, one of the bridges near downtown’s Trump Tower had been lifted over the Chicago River—a common sight in recent months amid incidents of looting or unrest in the city. The move has been used to restrict access to downtown.
Video of the Illinois National Guard pulling into the city’s downtown McCormick Place Convention Center circulated on social media Monday night, sparking concern among some. Tuesday morning, the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications said in a statement that the personnel were stationed in Chicago “to be ready to respond if needed” but that there were “no plans for them to be deployed.”
Several protests were planned in neighborhoods throughout the city for Wednesday night.
In Graham, North Carolina, where police cracked down on a peaceful demonstration, another march took place Tuesday. This one, which included hundreds, concluded without response from police, according to the Burlington Times-News, part of the USA TODAY Network.
About 200 protesters marched through the North Carolina capitol of Raleigh, WRAL-TV reported. The TV station added arrests were made after protesters threw fireworks and other items at police. The protest was declared unlawful and was broken up around 10 p.m., the outlet reported.
In Minneapolis, police arrested several demonstrators from among about 30 who had gathered in the city’s uptown, WCCO-TV reported.
Hundreds marched through Portland and Seattle, Washington, on Tuesday, two cities that have seen ongoing protests.
In Portland, demonstrators chanted “This is what democracy looks like” and some were seen openly carrying guns. The National Guard was on standby.
Two groups marched through Seattle with one carrying American flags and chanting “Black lives matter.
Left-leaning demonstrators planned Election Day protests for weeks.
Some protesters are already gearing up for a longer, more sustained pushback. Organizers at ShutDownDC plan for more aggressive actions as the week goes on depending on the outcome of the election, such as if President Donald Trump were to win reelection or to question the election outcome.

66,Modi Fails In Attempt To Manoeuvre Elections: PM Imran,https://abbtakk.tv/en/modi-fails-in-attempt-to-manoeuvre-elections-pm-imran/,"April 6, 2019","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday has said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has failed in its attempt to manoeuvre the elections by igniting tensions between the two nations as the United States of America (USA) has confirmed that none of Pakistan’s F-16 aircraft was crashed during an assault with the Indian jets.
PM Imran Khan took to Twitter and told that Modi-led Indian government has failed in its attempt to manoeuvre elections and none of the Pakistani F-16 was crashed.
He wrote on his timeline; “The truth always prevails and is always the best policy.”
The truth always prevails and is always the best policy. BJP's attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F 16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan's fleet.

“BJP’s attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F-16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan’s fleet,” he added.
A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) once again exposed Indian lies by sharing a picture of unfired 4 missiles recovered from downed IAF jet MiG-21 jet.
DG ISPR took to twitter and said, “IAF claim of hitting F-16 by their Mig 21 before having been shot down by PAF gets exposed. All 4 missile seeker heads recovered intact from the wreckage & held.”
IAF claim of hitting F-16 by their Mig 21 before having been shot down by PAF gets exposed. All 4 missile seeker heads recovered intact from the wreckage & held.

In his earlier tweet, Major General Asif Ghafoor urged India to speak the truth after US defense official debunked India’s claim of shooting down PAF F-16 jet.
“Truth always prevails. India needs introspection especially over atrocities in Occupied Kashmir,” he tweeted.
Unites States’ renowned news publication ‘Foreign Policy’ magazine has rebuffed claims of Indian authorities stating that one of its fighter pilots shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in an aerial battle in February.
According to Foreign Policy, India’s false claims were grounded after two senior defense officials of the United States told the magazine that U.S. personnel recently counted Islamabad’s F-16s and found none missing.
The magazine, in its article, claimed that India may have misled the international community about what happened that day.
It may be noted that the dogfight between India and Pakistan took place on February 27.

67,FO Warns India to Stay Away Dragging Pakistani In Its Election,https://abbtakk.tv/en/fo-warns-india-to-stay-away-dragging-pakistani-in-its-election/,"January 31, 2019","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has urged India to stop playing anti-Pakistan rhetoric in its domestic politics and stay away to drag Pakistan in its elections.
The views made by the Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal during his weekly news briefing in Islamabad on Thursday.
The Spokesperson said summoning of Pakistani high Commissioner late last night by Indian Foreign Secretary on the phone call by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to Mir Waiz Umer Farooq is just a political gimmickry and electioneering.
The Spokesperson said Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua summoned Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad on Thursday and lodged a protest with him over late night summoning of our high commissioner.
The Foreign Secretary stressed that the status of Jammu and Kashmir is internationally accepted as disputed territory and Pakistan will continue to support Kashmiris in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.
The spokesperson said as Indian atrocities continue in Occupied Kashmir we urge the international community to call upon India to stop the bloodshed in Kashmir.
He said 5th February-Kashmir Solidarity Day is also commemorative of the 26th year of detention of Dr Qasim Faktu, husband of Aasia Indrabi. He said the detention of both in Indian jails on trumped-up charges is a gross violation of human rights by India.
Responding to a question about Afghan peace talks the Foreign Office spokesperson said that Pakistan has on the request of the United States and Afghanistan facilitated the Afghan peace process and dialogue with the Taliban as a shared responsibility for peace in the region.
He said there are certain actors who want perpetual conflict in the region for their vested interests but Pakistan urges the United States, Afghanistan and Taliban to remain watchful of these detracting elements who are trying to undermine the nascent peace process.
To another question, Dr Muhammad Faisal said the announcement by Pakistan`s Prime Minister about keeping open the Torkham border is  a major step to promote bilateral trade and people to people contacts with Afghanistan.
He said Pakistan has always emphasized the need for deepening bilateral relations with Afghanistan.
The Spokesperson said with the efforts of Pakistan`s embassy in Kabul and consulate in Qandahar a Pakistani prisoner Ejaz Shah has been released before seven months of completion of his sentence and has been handed over to Pakistani authorities by Afghanistan.
Replying to a question regarding the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities, the spokesperson said that  India is callously continuing with state-sponsored terrorism and it should alleviate Pakistan`s concerns regarding the use of Afghan soil for launching terrorist attacks on Pakistani soil instead of levelling farfetched allegations against Islamabad.
To a question regarding Director of US Intelligence Daniel Coats` remarks about Pakistan in the context of terrorism, the spokesperson said we have raised the issue with the US side that such controversial statements will be counterproductive and have the potential to adversely affect the peace and stability of the region.
He said Pakistan has played an exemplary role in the war against terrorism rendering immense sacrifices in men and material.
Dr Faisal said Pakistan continues to play its constructive role for stabilizing the region and its efforts are being highly acknowledged by the US leadership.

68,Newspaper Pays Damages To Melania Trump Over False Report,https://abbtakk.tv/en/newspaper-pays-damages-to-melania-trump-over-false-report/,"January 26, 2019","LONDON: Britain’s Telegraph newspaper has apologised and paid damages to US First Lady Melania Trump after publishing an article it says contains many false statements.
The newspaper said Saturday it apologises “unreservedly” to Mrs Trump and her family for any embarrassment caused by the content of a cover story published Jan 19 in the newspaper’s weekly magazine supplement.
“As a mark of our regret we have agreed to pay Mrs Trump substantial damages as well as her legal costs,” The Telegraph said. The newspaper did not disclose the size of the settlement with Mrs Trump.
The Telegraph said it falsely characterised Mrs Trump’s father’s personality, falsely reported the reasons she left an architecture programme, and falsely reported her career as a model was unsuccessful before she met Donald Trump.
“We accept that Mrs Trump was a successful professional model in her own right before she met her husband and obtained her own modelling work without his assistance,” the newspaper said, also acknowledging it had incorrectly reported the year when the couple first met.
“The claim that Mrs Trump cried on election night is also false,” The Telegraph said.
It also retracted the statement that Mrs Trump’s father, mother and sister had relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Trump.
The Telegraph is one of Britain’s leading broadsheet newspapers and is traditionally aligned with the Conservative Party.
It is not the first time Mrs Trump has successfully challenged the British press. She received damages and an apology from the Daily Mail in 2017 after bringing a libel action against the popular tabloid.

Hasina’s ruling Awami League party and its allies won 288 seats in the 300-seat parliament, with the main opposition securing only six seats, Election Commission secretary Helal Uddin Ahmed said.
Hasina’s government had mounted a crackdown on the opposition, an alliance led by the Bangladesh National Party, which urged the country’s election commission to void the results.Although, Bangladesh’s opposition has rejected the “farcical” results of national elections officially declared to have been won by the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, in a landslide.
The Bangladesh election commission said early on Monday that Hasina’s Awami League had won a record third consecutive term, taking 287 of the country’s 298 parliamentary seats.
“My congratulations to the Awami League,” said Helal Uddin Ahmed, secretary of the election commission secretariat, in a televised speech, reading the results.Deadly violence and bitter rivalry that marred the election campaign spilt over into the voting day, even as authorities imposed tight security with 600,000 troops, police and other security forces deployed across the country.
Thirteen people were killed in clashes between Awami League and BNP supporters, police said, while three men were shot by police who said they were protecting polling booths.

Three men were shot by police while six others died in clashes between activists from the ruling Awami League Party and opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), police said.
An auxiliary police member was killed after being attacked by opposition activists armed with guns and sticks, according to officials.Voting is being held under tight security until 4 pm (1000 GMT) and polls have predicted a record fourth term for Hasina.
Bangladesh’s leader has been lauded for boosting economic growth in the poor Asian nation during an unbroken decade in power and for welcoming Rohingya refugees fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar.
But critics accuse her of authoritarianism and crippling the opposition — including arch-rival Khaleda Zia who is serving 17 years in prison. The election campaign was marred by violence between supporters of Hasina’s Awami League and Zia’s BNP.
Some 600,000 security personnel were deployed across the South Asian country, including at 40,000 polling stations.Authorities ordered mobile operators to shut down 3G and 4G services until midnight on Sunday “to prevent the spread of rumours” that could trigger unrest.
The election-day deaths brought to 19 the official police toll for election violence since the ballot was announced on November 8.
Police said they acted “in self-defence” in the southern town of Bashkhali, when they opened fire on opposition supporters who attempted to storm a polling booth, killing one.
In a separate incident, another man was shot by police after he tried to steal a ballot box.

Earlier, former MQM lawmaker and Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Syed Ali Raza Abidi has been shot dead in Karachi’s DHA neighbourhood.
According to the details, former member of National Assembly from Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Syed Ali Raza Abidi was earlier critically injured in an attack on his vehicle in Karachi’s upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) neighbourhood and shifted to PNS Shifa hospital, where Abidi succumbed to his injuries.
Initial reports suggested that unidentified assailants opened fire on his vehicle outside his residence at Khayaban-e-Ghazi in DHA Phase-V.

According to Police, the shooting incident took place in Defense’s Khayaban-e-Ittehad area.
It has been learnt that Abidi had gone there to meet his relatives and had just sat in his car after meeting them, when unknown assailants opened fire on the vehicle.
According to police, unknown gunmen opened fire on Abidi’s vehicle and sped away.
SSP South told media that Abidi was shot in head and neck as soon as he got off his car outside his home.
“It was premature to conclude whether the assailants were riding a bike or a car,” he said.Police and Rangers personnel have cordoned off the site of the attack and are collecting evidence.
Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Syed Kaleem Imam has taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police authorities.
This comes two days after two Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) workers were gunned down in Usmania Society.
Earlier this month, six people were wounded when a low-intensity blast hit an MQM’s Milad gathering in Gulistan-e-Johar.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has taken notice of the shooting and directed police chief to submit a report.Abidi, who had been affiliated with Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), had resigned from basic membership of the party in September citing “personal reasons”.
“This is to bring to your attention that I will not be able to continue participation with MQM Pakistan due to personal reasons,” he had said in his resignation letter to MQM-P Convenor Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Abidi was one of the leaders who had stood with former convener Farooq Sattar in the buildup to 2018 elections when MQM-P was subject to an internal power battle.
He was the owner of the famous Karachi eatery, Biryani of the Seas.
Abidi was quite active on Twitter, with his last tweet coming just four hours before the fatal attack on him.
The counter press conference by PTI is just repetition of what they have been alleging for the past 5 years on the container. Nothing new nor substantial in reply to PMLN’s presser, except that now PTI is officially speaking on behalf of NAB Courts.

Profile
Former MQM lawmaker and Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Syed Ali Raza Abidi’s affiliation with MQM goes back to the 1988, when he was a student of SM Commerce College. When the army operation against the party started, Abidi – who had seen several tortured bodies of his colleagues – distanced himself from politics.
Although he went to the United States for his undergraduate degree in science and business management from Boston University, he had once said that he was in touch with what was going on back home. “It was disturbing at time and I felt helpless.”
After coming back in 1998, he chose to be an entrepreneur – he was part of distributing Walls ice cream, and later joined the seafood processing business Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) run by the family.Abidi’s father, Syed Ikhlaq Hussain Abidi, was also actively involved with the MQM and was an MNA from NA-250.
Abidi jumped back into active politics in 2008, and formed the Professionals Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) for MQM.
His career in politics began in 2013 when he was given the ticket by MQM to contest elections. Being his first time in elections he was able to win and got himself a seat in the national assembly.
However, there was some controversy surrounding his seat as a MNA as he allegedly resigned from his position recently when he joined Pak Sarzameen Party and thus left MQM.
He was member of the National Assembly, from June 2013 to May 2018.He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) from Constituency NA-251 (Karachi-XIII) in Pakistani general election, 2013. He received 81,603 votes and defeated Raja Azhar Khan, a candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
The former MQM leader was a well-educated politician and did his immediate schooling from Karachi St. Patrick School. He got his B.com degree from DHA Degree College and I.com degree from S.M Commerce College. Then he went to states to complete his marketing degree from Boston University.
Ali Raza Abidi had plenty of experience in marketing sector and was the CEO of Akhlaq enterprises.

Sources stated that both the Prosecution and Defendants have received all pertaining at authorized documents to challenge Accountability Court’s verdict in Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Flasghip Investment Reference Case.Both parties can contact the Accountability Court within a period of 10 days.
Earlier yesterday (December 24), National Accountability Bureau (NAB) decided to challenge former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s acquittal in Flagship reference.
The anti-corruption watchdogs claimed that they will file an appeal against the accountability court’s decision soon.

The decision was taken in a meeting presided over by NAB chairman Justice (r) Javed Iqbal at the anti-graft agency’s headquarters in Islamabad.
Senior legal experts, concerned director generals and senior officials attended the meeting.The meeting after detailed consultation decided to challenge the accountability court verdict, while Justice (r) Javed Iqbal directed the legal experts to challenge the court’s verdict.
Earlier, while reading out the short order, Accountability Judge Arshad Malik today (Monday) said there was no case against Nawaz in the Flagship reference.
While in Al-Azizia reference, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for corruption. The conviction, centred on family businesses in the Middle East, is his second stemming from a corruption investigation spurred by the Panama Papers leak and comes as new Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to tackle endemic graft in Pakistan.

Sharif, a three-time prime minister, has denied all the charges against him.
He was taken into custody and will be sent to Kot Lakhpat prison in Lahore, and was also fined 3.47 billion rupees ($25 million).
Security was tight at the court, with some scuffles breaking out between Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supporters and security forces, who responded with tear gas.

Sources also stated that Nawaz Sharif will seek other legal options against the court’s probable arrest orders.
Supporters and well wishers of the Sharif family arrived at the Accountability Court. Strict Security measures were taken prior to the hearing.PML-N Supremo Nawaz Sharif appeared total 127 times before the Accountability Court in 183 held sessions. Nawaz appeared 70 times before Judge Mohammad Bashir and 57 times before Judge Mohammad Arshad Malik.
UK-based Flagship Investment Limited
The charge against the family is that Hassan Nawaz, the former premier’s youngest son, set up an investment firm in 2001, with an office registered in the United Kingdom. At the time he was 25-years-old.Earlier this month, during a hearing, the NAB stated that Nawaz Sharif even received an amount of 0.78 million AED from the investment firm that he claims to have no stake in.
The accountability court had to determine how and from where did Hasan get the funds to set up the investment firm?
Al-Azizia Steel Mills
Hussain Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister’s elder son, claims that he received a sum of $5.4 million from his grandfather to establish the steel conglomerate in Saudi Arabia.
The payment was made by a Qatari royal on the request of the elder Sharif. Thereafter, scrap machinery was transported from their Ahli Steel Mills in Dubai to Jeddah to establish Al-Azizia in 2001.The JIT constituted to investigate the graft allegations insist that the real owner of the mills was Nawaz Sharif, and it was being operated by his son on his behalf. Hussain was 29-years-old at the time.
The JIT also held that Nawaz Sharif received 97 per cent profit as ‘gifts’ from Hill Metals Establishment, another company established by Hussain Nawaz Sharif in 2005, in Saudi Arabia.
Of the amount, Nawaz Sharif transferred 77 per cent to his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif. (Maryam is not accused in this reference).
Here as well, the NAB claims that since Sharif received a large profit from Hussain’s companies, he is the real owner and not his son.The Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from politics for life over the allegations last year, and directed an anti-corruption body to investigate three different charges regarding his family’s properties and businesses.
The months-long saga has seen him appear before accountability courts 165 times since September 2017. In July this year, he was convicted in one case revolving around family properties in London, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
He was in London at the time as his wife received cancer treatment, but returned to Pakistan days ahead of the election, only to be arrested and imprisoned on arrival.
He was released in September after a court suspended his sentence pending an appeal hearing.He was acquitted on the third charge, relating to business in Britain.
Sharif has been prime minister three times but power has been a rough ride.
He was first expelled from office in 1993 on suspicion of corruption. He won an election in 1997, only to be ousted and exiled after a military coup in 1999.
He returned to Pakistan in 2007 and took power once more in 2013 until his ousting last year.

The decision was taken in a meeting presided over by NAB chairman Justice (r) Javed Iqbal at the anti-graft agency’s headquarters in Islamabad.
Senior legal experts, concerned director generals and senior officials attended the meeting.The meeting after detailed consultation decided to challenge the accountability court verdict, while Justice (r) Javed Iqbal directed the legal experts to challenge the court’s verdict.
Earlier, while reading out the short order, Accountability Judge Arshad Malik today (Monday) said there was no case against Nawaz in the Flagship reference.
While in Al-Azizia reference, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for corruption. The conviction, centred on family businesses in the Middle East, is his second stemming from a corruption investigation spurred by the Panama Papers leak, and comes as new Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to tackle endemic graft in Pakistan.

Sharif, a three-time prime minister, has denied all the charges against him.
He was taken into custody and will be sent to Kot Lakhpat prison in Lahore, and was also fined 3.47 billion rupees ($25 million).
Security was tight at the court, with some scuffles breaking out between Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supporters and security forces, who responded with tear gas.

Sources also stated that Nawaz Sharif will seek other legal options against the court’s probable arrest orders.
Supporters and we wishers of the Sharif family arrived at the Accountability Court. Strict Security measures were taken prior to the hearing.PML-N Supremo Nawaz Sharif has appeared total 127 times before the Accountability Court in 183 held sessions. Nawaz appeared 70 times before Judge Mohammad Bashir and 57 times before Judge Mohammad Arshad Malik.
Earlier on Friday (December 21), Nawaz’s lawyers submitted the newly received documents and UK Land Registry Attested Documents to the Accountability Court.
Although, upon submission of the documents after couple days of the formal hearing session, Prosecutor of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) expressed anger over the act.
UK-based Flagship Investment Limited
The charge against the family is that Hassan Nawaz, the former premier’s youngest son, set up an investment firm in 2001, with an office registered in the United Kingdom. At the time he was 25-years-old.Earlier this month, during a hearing, the NAB stated that Nawaz Sharif even received an amount of 0.78 million AED from the investment firm that he claims to have no stake in.
The accountability court had to determine how and from where did Hasan get the funds to set up the investment firm?
Al-Azizia Steel Mills
Hussain Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister’s elder son, claims that he received a sum of $5.4 million from his grandfather to establish the steel conglomerate in Saudi Arabia.
The payment was made by a Qatari royal on the request of the elder Sharif. Thereafter, scrap machinery was transported from their Ahli Steel Mills in Dubai to Jeddah to establish Al-Azizia in 2001.The JIT constituted to investigate the graft allegations insist that the real owner of the mills was Nawaz Sharif, and it was being operated by his son on his behalf. Hussain was 29-years-old at the time.
The JIT also held that Nawaz Sharif received 97 per cent profit as ‘gifts’ from Hill Metals Establishment, another company established by Hussain Nawaz Sharif in 2005, in Saudi Arabia.
Of the amount, Nawaz Sharif transferred 77 per cent to his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif. (Maryam is not accused in this reference).
Here as well, the NAB claims that since Sharif received a large profit from Hussain’s companies, he is the real owner and not his son.The Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from politics for life over the allegations last year, and directed an anti-corruption body to investigate three different charges regarding his family’s properties and businesses.
The months-long saga has seen him appear before accountability courts 165 times since September 2017. In July this year, he was convicted in one case revolving around family properties in London, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
He was in London at the time as his wife received cancer treatment, but returned to Pakistan days ahead of the election, only to be arrested and imprisoned on arrival.
He was released in September after a court suspended his sentence pending an appeal hearing.He was acquitted on the third charge, relating to business in Britain.
Sharif has been prime minister three times but power has been a rough ride.
He was first expelled from office in 1993 on suspicion of corruption. He won an election in 1997, only to be ousted and exiled after a military coup in 1999.
He returned to Pakistan in 2007 and took power once more in 2013 until his ousting last year.

79,India’s Ruling BJP Faces Historic Defeat in Elections,https://abbtakk.tv/en/bjp-faces-historic-defeat-in-elections/,"December 11, 2018","New Delhi (December 11, 2018): India’s ruling party could lose power in three key states, four TV networks said on Tuesday, citing vote count leads, potentially handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014, and months ahead of a general election.
The main opposition Congress party could form governments in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan, all big heartland states that powered Modi to a landslide win in the 2014 general election.

Analysts say a big loss for Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would signify rural dismay and help unite the opposition, despite his high personal popularity in the face of criticism that he did not deliver on promises of jobs for young people and better conditions for farmers.
“We’ve all voted for Congress this time and our candidate is winning here,” said Bishnu Prasad Jalodia, a wheat grower in Madhya Pradesh, where it appears as if Congress might have to woo smaller parties to keep out Modi’s party.
“BJP ignored us farmers, they ignored those of us at the bottom of the pyramid.”
The elections are also a test for Rahul Gandhi, president of the left-of-centre Congress, who is trying to forge a broad alliance with regional groups and face Modi with his most serious challenge yet, in the election that must be held by May.In Rajasthan, the Congress was leading in 114 of the 199 seats contested, against 81 for the BJP, in the initial round of voting, India Today TV said.
In Chhattisgarh, the Congress was ahead in 59 of the 90 seats at stake, with the BJP at 24. In Madhya Pradesh, the most important of the five states that held assembly elections over the past few weeks, Congress was ahead, with 112 of 230 seats. The Hindu nationalist BJP was at 103, the network said.
Three other TV channels also said Congress was leading in the three states, with regional parties leading in two smaller states that also voted, Telangana in the south and Mizoram in the northeast.
Poll analysts cautioned that with the counting in preliminary stages, it was still too early to predict the outcome of state races involving millions of voters.
Local issues usually dominate state polls, but politicians are seeing the elections as a pointer to the national vote just months away.Indian markets recovered some ground after an early fall as the central bank governor’s unexpected resignation the previous day shocked investors.
The rupee currency dropped as much as 1.5 percent to 72.465 per dollar, while bond yields rose 12 basis points to 7.71 percent after the resignation of Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel.
The broader NSE share index was down 1.3 percent, with investors cautious ahead of the election results.
“As the three erstwhile BJP states have a large agrarian population, the BJP’s drubbing could be interpreted to mean that farm unrest is real,” Nomura said in a research note before the results.
“A rout of the BJP on its homeground states should encourage cohesion among the opposition parties to strengthen the non-BJP coalition for the general elections.”
Rahul Gandhi, the fourth generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, has sought to build a coalition of regional groups, some headed by experienced firebrand, ambitious politicians.
Congress has already said it would not name Rahul Gandhi, who is seen as lacking experience, as a prime ministerial candidate.
“When one and one become eleven, even the mighty can be dethroned,” opposition leader Akhilesh Yadav said of the prospect of growing opposition unity.

Trump said he was impressed by the 48-year-old Nauert, a former anchor of Fox and Friends, one of the television-loving president’s favorite shows.“She’s very talented, very smart, very quick, and I think she´s going to be respected by all,” Trump told reporters.
Nauert said on Twitter she was “humbled” by Trump’s confidence in her and looked forward “to continuing the outstanding job Amb. Haley has done representing your administration and the American people.”
Nauert, who had been rumored as the top pick for the job since Haley’s resignation, become the spokeswoman of the State Department after Trump’s election despite no previous background in foreign affairs.

Khaleda, who has twice been the country’s prime minister and shares a long-standing rivalry with the current leader Sheikh Hasina, was jailed in February after being convicted for misappropriation of funds for an orphanage.
She denies the allegations and says it is aimed at keeping her away from politics.Her ability to contest the polls has been in doubt since her incarceration but colleagues in her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have said they were hoping she would be released ahead of the elections.
With weeks to go for the Dec. 30 polls though, Attorney General Mahbubey Alam said on Wednesday that, according to the law, even if Khaleda was released from jail, she would not be allowed to contest the polls.
His comments came a day after the Bangladesh high court ruled against petitions filed by five BNP members convicted of corruption who sought a stay on their sentences to stand in the election, Alam said.

“Are politicians the only corrupt people in society,”
“One-sided accountability will not work in Pakistan. Politicians are not the only ones who are corrupt, unfortunately, everyone in society including myself is corrupt. If there is to be accountability let there be across the board accountability. Let the judiciary be accountable let the civil and military bureaucracy be accountable. But for this we are not ready,” Rabbani stressed.The PPP leader also called for the formation of a federal accountability commission comprising all stakeholders.
“NAB would be a subordinate of this commission which would decide if a reference had to be filed,” he said.
Rabbani added that when it came to accountability politicians were easy prey. “If you want society to improve and eliminate corruption, the root cause needs to be addressed.”
Rabbani was critical of the standoff between the government and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sajrani over Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry.
A day earlier, Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani placed a ban on Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry from attending the session until he apologised for his outburst against the opposition.Following a cabinet meeting, Chaudhry quoted the prime minister saying: “Nobody has the right to disrespect any minister.” The minister added if the Senate chairman was unable to bring order to the House, then the government would have to think over its strategy. Chaudhry further said that he was voted in by the people of Pakistan while the Sanjrani was not elected.
Rabbani said in the past no dictator had the audacity to say anything against the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker. “Today aspersions are raised on the Senate chairman,” Rabbani added.
Turing to the acting Senate Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla, Rabbani said: “The prime minister is elected to the office through indirect votes of National Assembly members.”
During his address, Rabbani emphasised that he could not accept that the statements about the Senate chairman were made by the prime minister or the cabinet. “I cannot accept this because they [prime minister, cabinet] would not destroy the constitution like this.”The PPP leader said the government had come into power on the platform of rooting out corruption, questioning why under trial cases were being raised on the floor.
In response to Rabbani, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan said there was no discussion of the Senate chairman’s conduct during the cabinet meeting.
“I am proud of Prime Minister Imran Khan who said in the cabinet meeting that he was willing to sacrifice his government but would not tolerate corrupt ministers,” Ali Muhammad Khan added.
The minister emphasised that they were on the same page with Rabbani and would work together against corruption. “We will not let any damage be done to Parliament.”Govt Has Increased Duties To Cut Imports, Minister Informs Senate

Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) member and federal Minister for Housing Tahir Bashir Cheema also backed the demand saying that Sarwar will not let Chief Minister (CM) Usman Buzdar run the provincial government.
The video, which surfaced on Saturday, shows a meeting between Tareen, Punjab Minister for Mines and Minerals Hafiz Ammar Yasir, and PML-Q leaders Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and Federal Minister for Housing Tariq Bashir Cheema.
In the video, Cheema can be heard speaking to Tareen. “Sir, control Sarwar! He will not let your chief minister continue,” he tells Tareen in a candid manner.The video has raised questions over the how much authority PTI’s Usman Buzdar wields chief minister in the province.
Responding to a question over he video, Punjab Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan said the video and Cheema’s words were being taken “out of context”.“The centre of power according to the law and Constitution is Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and the chief minister’s secretariat. A hundred percent of ministers stand with the chief minister and are working under his leadership,” he said.
“There are apprehensions and reservations which were being conveyed to the leadership, which is what Tariq Cheema was doing during the meeting,” said Chohan, adding that needless hype should not be created around the statement.
He said that Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and other allies of the PTI were working with his party and Chief Minister Buzdar.“There are differences in politics which are minor issues. Cheema was speaking on this [differences] which is not a big deal. This doesn’t mean that the chief minister is weak,” he said.

Ilahi said that we have good relations with Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and good relations will continue in the future.

He said his colleague, Tariq Cheema, was merely raising a reservation in an internal meeting between coalition partners.
“If we do not discuss issues in our own homes, then where will we do it? If our member does not speak to us, then how will his reservations be addressed?” Elahi said.
Elahi said Cheema had a longstanding concern regarding interference in matters related to his constituency. “This is what he raised with Jehangir Tareen,” he said.
“The objective of such meetings is often to raise objections and resolve issues. PTI are our coalition partners. Reservations are raised and issues are resolved on a routine basis,” he said, adding: “You cannot stop anyone from interfering. But reservations can only be addressed if they are raised. This is common in every party and coalition.”
Speaking about the upcoming elections for vacant Senate seats, he said the PML-Q was supporting their coalition partners.
“About the Senate elections, the entire PTI leadership is involved, and our party is fully supporting Imran Khan’s party. We have supported them in the past and are supporting them in these elections as well,” he said.
The PML-Q leader said he has good relations with Governor Punjab Chaudhry Sarwar, and rejected rumours of there being friction between members of the two allied parties.“We have a commitment with Imran Khan.

In what opponents condemned as an illegal move, Sirisena dissolved parliament on Friday and announced a January election after it became clear his designated prime minister — former president Mahinda Rajapakse — would not be able to command a majority in the current legislature.
Rakapakse and ousted premier Ranil Wikremesinghe, who has refused to leave his post, have been battling for power for two weeks as international concern grows over the mounting turmoil in the strategically important island nation.
Sirisena signed a decree dismissing the island’s 225-member assembly and scheduled parliamentary elections for January 5, nearly two years ahead of schedule.
In a bid to head off any revolt against his action he also suspended parliament.

There was no immediate comment from Wickremesinghe, but his United National Party (UNP) said it will challenge Sirisena’s sacking of the legislature.
“This dissolution by the President is illegal and goes against the constitution,” the UNP said on Twitter. “We will be fighting this to ensure that democracy reigns supreme in the country.”
“He has robbed the people of their rights and the democracy that we have enjoyed,” the UNP said.
Sirisena had come under increased international pressure from the United States, the United Nations and the European Union to allow parliament to vote on which prime minister should form a government.Washington swiftly criticised Sirisena’s latest move.
“The US is deeply concerned by news the Sri Lanka parliament will be dissolved, further deepening the political crisis,” the US State Department said in a statement on Twitter.
“As a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,” it said.

Chief Election Commissioner Nurul Huda said in a nationally broadcast speech that all preparations have been made for “fair” polls.
The opposition has expressed fears that the election will not be democratic and has threatened protests.
Detained opposition leader Khaleda Zia was sent sent back to jail a few hours before the announcement, after a month of treatment in hospital.Zia will almost certainly be banned from contesting the election as she has been jailed for corruption and has virtually no time to appeal.
Her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted the last election in 2014 over fears it would be rigged. The BNP and its allies have not yet said whether they will take part in the December poll.
Huda said nominations had to be submitted by November 19 and called on all political parties to take part. He promised “a level playing field” for all contenders and said the army would be deployed to maintain order on polling day.
The ruling Awami League and its main ally Jatiya Party welcomed the announcement, saying they were “happy” with the voting date.The BNP and its allies have held talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on their election demands which included releasing the party leader but Hasina rejected the move.
Hasina also turned down the opposition request to dissolve parliament and let a neutral caretaker government assume office ahead of the election.

The elections – for all 435 seats in the House and 35 of the Senate’s 100 seats – were also widely seen as a referendum on Donald Trump’s presidency.
Currently, Republicans control the Senate 51 seats to 42 seats for the Democrats.Predictions from U.S. news media, several state election departments, and political experts said that the Democrats would take at least 10 seats in the House from Republicans, and Republicans would take at least two seats from Democrats.

Polling stations opened on the East Coast amid a battle by both Republicans and Democrats to take control of the two houses of Congress.
Governor posts and seats in state legislatures are also up for grabs.
The mid-term elections come half way through Mr Trump’s four years in office and follow a divisive campaign.
Polls opened first in the East Coast states of Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Virginia.
Mr Trump attended three rallies on the final day of campaigning, telling his supporters: “Everything we have achieved is at stake tomorrow.”
In the first district of Pennsylvania – a Republican seat the Democrats are trying to flip – they haven’t seen lines like this since 2008. Big early turnout #MidtermElections2018 ⁦@BBCWorld⁩ pic.twitter.com/fQTVz6XtfZ
— Nick Bryant (@NickBryantNY) November 6, 2018
Barack Obama – on the campaign trail for the Democratic party – said “the character of our country is on the ballot”. The former president tweeted the vote “might be the most important of our lifetimes”.
What is at stake?
Americans are voting for all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of 100 seats in the Senate – the two bodies that make up Congress. Governors are also being chosen in 36 out of 50 states.
If Republicans maintain their hold on both the Senate and the House of Representatives, they could build on their agenda and that of President Trump.
But if the Democrats wrest control of one or both chambers, they could stymie or even reverse Mr Trump’s plans.
Pollsters suggest Democrats may win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives, and possibly 15 or so extra seats.However, the Democrats are expected to fall short of the two seats they need to win control of the Senate.
Trump’s invincible, but for how much longer?
Presidents have always commanded attention. Theodore Roosevelt called the White House his “bully pulpit” – the place from which he could demand attention and advance his agenda.
But Donald Trump has his own bully pulpit, 55 million Twitter followers and a penchant for saying the outrageous.
You feel that everything in American life is a reaction to what Donald Trump has said: his followers adoring it, his opponents deploring it and the candidates actually on the ballot trying to get a word in edgeways.
And this has generated real excitement in these elections – both for and against him.What happens on election day?
After months of campaigning, speculation, and billions of dollars spent on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters finally have their say.
Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives have raised $649m (£500m) from individual donors, more than double the $312m tally for the Republicans.
Democrats are hoping to achieve a “mid-term wave” – a sweeping victory that changes the shape of the political map in the US.
Hour-by-hour guide to election night
Should Trump be worried?Some 34.3 million people have cast early ballots and the real number is probably higher, according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million.
In Texas, early voting has exceeded the entire turnout in 2014.
However, thunderstorms are forecast for Tuesday along the eastern coast, as well as snowstorms in the Midwest, which could affect turnout.

95,Brazil’s Next President Declares War On ‘Fake News’ Media,https://abbtakk.tv/en/brazils-next-president-declares-war-on-fake-news-media/,"November 5, 2018","Sao Paulo (November 05, 2018): Brazil’s To-be President Jair Bolsonaro, attacking critical press outlets almost daily on social media is not enough. Once in office, he vows to hit their bottom line.
The fiery former Army captain is threatening to slash ad buys with adversarial media groups, striking at the financial foundations of Brazil’s free press.
After a campaign in which Bolsonaro dismissed investigative reporting as “fake news” invented by a corrupt establishment and his supporters went after individual journalists, the threats are sending a chill through the country’s newsrooms. When he was asked in a TV interview last week to newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil’s largest circulation daily, Bolsonaro’s answer was curt.
“That newspaper is done,” Bolsonaro said in a tense TV Globo interview. “As far as I’m concerned with government advertising — press that acts like that, lying shamelessly, won’t have any support from the federal government.”
Several seasoned journalists working for Brazil’s biggest news organizations told Reuters in recent weeks they have started to throttle back their criticism, fearing a backlash from the Bolsonaro government — and violence from his supporters.
Brazilian press watchdogs said there has been an escalation of threats and aggression against reporters. Investigative journalism group Abraji began tracking the incidents in Brazil’s most polarized election since the return to democratic government in 1985 after two decades of military dictatorship.
Most of the attacks on journalists were by Bolsonaro supporters, according to Abraji, which recorded more than 150 cases of campaign reporters coming under threat. Roughly half involved physical violence and the rest were online hate campaigns.“Treating the press as an antagonist is not a new tactic, but the aggressive tone and frequency of Bolsonaro’s attacks are very worrying,” said the group’s coordinator, Marina Atoji.
Bolsonaro’s supporters said the Brazilian media has a leftist bias and they have turned to social media for news about him.
“The worst thing was they tried to crucify Bolsonaro for his controversial statements on women, gays and blacks,” said Emilio Kerber, an Air Force major who ran for Congress in Bolsonaro’s small coalition. “But Bolsonaro has millions of followers on social media and he won anyway.”
Press aides for Bolsonaro did not respond to a request for comment. The president-elect has disavowed any supporters who resort to violence. He said he respects freedom of the press and only asks that it be exercised responsibly.

Pompeo made the comment as he welcomed long-delayed legislative elections in Afghanistan, saying the United States was “encouraged” by voter turnout, despite reports of widespread problems including poll centers that failed to open or lacked voter rolls.“Our expectation is that Pakistan will not provide safe harbor to terrorists on their western border,” Pompeo told reporters when asked about Islamabad s role.
“We couldn t have made that message any more clear,” he said, adding: “Pakistan will be held to account if they don t achieve that, if they re not sincere in that effort.”
“Everyone wants a reconciliation in Afghanistan and to achieve that, you can t have a safe harbor for Taliban, for Haqqani and for others inside of Pakistan,” he said, listing extremist movements fighting in Afghanistan.President Donald Trump s administration last month cut $300 million in military aid to Pakistan after years of US complaints that Islamabad has kept nurturing ties with militants that target both Afghanistan and rival India.
Pakistan has countered that it has paid a heavy price internally for fighting militants and that it can help bring the Taliban to the table.
A Taliban delegation earlier this month met in Qatar with a US envoy. Pakistan s new Prime Minister Imran Khan is a longstanding supporter of negotiations to end the war in Afghanistan, where the United States has been deployed since 2001.

113,Shaukat Siddiqui To Challenge SJC’s Verdict,https://abbtakk.tv/en/shaukat-siddiqui-to-challenge-sjcs-verdict/,"October 15, 2018","Islamabad (October 15, 2018): Deposed Justice of Islamabad High Court (IHC), Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui has decided to challenge his disqualification from Supreme Judicial Council.
Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui has started consultation with his lawyers, Rasheed A Rizvi and Hamid Khan.

According to the sources, the verdict will be challenged in supreme court on Monday.
Earlier today, Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Mian Saqib Nisar remarked that the Supreme Judicial Council is “very active now” and the process of accountability has begun.
“All judges will be held accountable now,” the chief justice said while heading a bench hearing a case pertaining to the to Lahore High Court’s supervisory role over lower courts.

CJP said that the high courts have badly failed to play their supervisory role and that the concerned committees are also not monitoring their performances.
Every judge demands car, bungalow and other incentives but they are not giving their best for the judiciary, he continued.
“People have been crying and dying but are not getting injustice,” he added.The top judge added, “Supreme Court’s bench number 1 has wrapped up 7,000 cases but when we ask judges they say only 20 cases have been wrapped up.Further, Justice Nisar warned, “Those judges, who issue verdicts on very few cases, will also be tried under Article 209.”Earlier on October 11, President Arif Alvi removed Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as a judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), a notification issued by the law ministry said on Thursday.
The president took the decision after the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommended his removal, the statement added.A letter written by the SJC had emerged earlier in the day, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July earlier this year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.
“The council is unanimously of the opinion that in the matter of making his speech before the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi on [July 21] Mr. Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui […] had displayed conduct unbecoming of a judge of a high court and was, thus, guilty of misconduct and he is, therefore, liable to be removed from his office under Article 209(6) of the Constitution,” the communication read.While addressing an audience at the bar, Justice Siddiqui had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.
He had further claimed that the spy agency had approached IHC Chief Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi and said: “‘We do not want to let Nawaz Sharif and his daughter come out [of the prison] until elections, do not include Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on the bench [hearing Sharifs’ appeals]’.”Justice Siddiqui had offered no evidence to support the claims he made.
The IHC judge was facing a reference over his controversial speech, the third reference filed against him.
Earlier on July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments at the Rawalpindi District Bar Association by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.
The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.
The council did not consider another request of Justice Siddiqui to hold the proceedings of this reference in the open court.The judge had been alrea­dy facing a reference on misconduct earlier moved on the complaint by some retired employees of the Capital Development Authori­ty (CDA) for alleged refurbishment of his official residence beyond entitlement.
Likewise, a similar show-cause notice was issued to Justice Siddiqui under Article 209 (5)(6) of the Constitution by the SJC on a reference moved by Advocate Kulsum Khaliq on behalf of former member of the National Asse­mbly Jamsh­ed Ahmed Dasti alleging that the high court judge had, during one of the hearings on a case relating to the 20-day Faizabad sit-in, objected to a compromise between the federal government and the protesting Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah. The compromise was facilitated by the armed forces.

120,"Fazlur Rehman Meets Zardari, Disuses Grand Alliance",https://abbtakk.tv/en/fazlur-rehman-meets-zardari-disuses-grand-alliance/,"October 10, 2018","Islamabad (October 10, 2018): Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman Wednesday met with former president and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and agreed to give tough time to the government.
Sources said that the PPP and JUI-F leaders discussed the current political situation in the country. They also discussed the grand opposition alliance for giving tough time to the PTI-led government.Earlier on August 27,Pakistan Peoples’ Party co-chairman Asif Zarari had expressed displeasure ‘over the role of MMA President Maulana Fazlur Rehman’ during presidential elections.
The PPP met today to discuss the situation arising out of division in opposition parties over nomination of joint candidate for presidential election.During the meeting, sources said, the former president stated that there will always be a question mark on his role.
PPP had fielded Aitzaz Ahsan, while the opposition parties nominated Maulana Fazlur Rehman as their joint candidate against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Arif Alvi.
PPP had requested MMA chief to persuade PML-N president over Ahsan’s nomination, who met Shehbaz Sharif Sunday but failed to convince him.Surprisingly, the opposition parties nominated Fazlur Rehman which surprised the PPP.
Earlier today, opposition parties blame PPP for ditching them, however Zardari stuck to Aitzaz Ahsan as party’s candidate for country’s top office.
Earlier, talking to media in Islamabad, the chief of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and MMA president Fazlur Rehman on Monday expressed hope that PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari would reconsider his decision and have his party vote for him in the September 4 presidential election, despite increasing rift among the opposition parties.
Soon after senior PPP leaders blamed the PML-N and the media for the growing fissures within the opposition ‘alliance’, and seemed all but resigned to not reaching a consensus over a presidential candidate, Rehman — the opposition’s presidential nominee — said he would try and convince Zardari to back him.

“The PPP did not vote in the prime minister’s elections, which resulted in Imran Khan becoming the PM by four votes,” Rehman said in a press conference in Islamabad. “The act of dividing up the opposition is not popular in the public.
“It will be our effort to take him (Zardari) in confidence and convince him to reconsider his decision so that a joint candidate could contest.”
The JUI leader said he “would like to meet Zardari today” to convince him to withdraw PPP nominee Aitzaz Ahsan’s candidacy in his favour.
Rehman said he and PML-N both “wanted the opposition’s prime minister candidate to be from the PPP.“However, the PPP people themselves said that the PM candidate should be from the PML-N. When a consensus was reached, then [the PPP] decided not to vote, which dispersed the opposition, and turned our hope — our decision to go into the parliament and turn the tables — into disappointment and despair.”
“We would not want to give the same disappoint to our members once again,” he added. “A joint position on this issue should be presented.”
With the grand opposition alliance failing to reach consensus on a single nominee, the PPP’s Ahsan and JUI-F’s Rehman emerged as the two candidates challenging Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidate Dr Arif Alvi’s bid for the head of state’s office in the September 4 election.
The failure of the opposition parties to field a joint candidate is expected to provide a virtual walkover to Dr Alvi, an MNA from Karachi.

The inauguration of the project is part of government’s election manifesto of constructing five million houses for the shelter-less people in its five year tenure.
Speaking to the launching ceremony, the premier said that five million houses will be constructed over the next five years under the project, also dubbed as ‘Apna Ghar Authority’.

He sought to allay concerns regarding an impending economic meltdown in the country, saying he will take the country out of this “difficult time”.
He said that his government is trying hard to stable govt institutions.
Khan said he will present a roadmap before the nation listing steps the government will take to stabilize the economy.
The premier said he will “guide” the nation every week on his government’s economic plans.
“Have courage, there is nothing to worry about,” the prime minister said, assuring the nation that the turbulence in the economy won’t last long.Khan said that an impression has been created in the last 48 hours “as if the sky is going to fall [or] the day of judgement is upon us”, but instead sought to explain the issues faced by the economy.
He said the previous governments had taken loans recklessly, which has resulted in the country’s debt ballooning from $6 trillion to $30 trillion in the past 10 years alone.
He said that the previous PML-N government had started its term with a $3 billion current account deficit, but the 40-day-old Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government inherited an $18bn current account deficit.
“One country wants to invest USD20 in the housing industry in Pakistan,” Prime Minister Khan said.“Inshahullah, we will steer Pakistan out of crises. It’s a difficult time for us but this too will phase soon,” he said.
The prime minister said that he would devise a roadmap to address the challenges being faced by the country.
“The housing scheme is our real scheme. At least 40 industries are directly related with the housing scheme. When we launch the project, all these industries will benefit from it,” he said.
“Our target is to build five million affordable houses in five years. Only ordinary people will benefit from this scheme,” Khan said.“A common man who can never think of owning his house is our target. And our second target is to provide employment opportunities to our jobless youth,” he said, adding that 40 industries were directly linked with the housing project.
“We will encourage youth to set up their own construction companies to be part of this initiative,” the premier said.
Khan said that skill development program would also be launched to help youth benefit from the project.
The prime minister noted that 80 percent of American population build their homes through loans.Registration for the houses is also expected to begin today, sources said. However, they said that registration for the houses does not entail allotment and will only identify those in need.
The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has been given the task of collecting data to identify those in need, sources further said.
Areas where low-costing houses can be built, will also be identified. “The private sector has been made part of the housing project to give recommendations on completing the project in five years,” the sources added.
Initially, the pilot project will be launched in seven cities which include Faisalabad, Sukkur, Quetta, Dera Ismail Khan, Islamabad, Gilgit and Muzaffarabad.Last month PM Imran had announced he will take ownership of the initiative in order to ensure smooth implementation and remove any administrative bottlenecks.
“Provision of five million houses equipped with all basic facilities, and regularisation of slums is the foremost priority of the government and a part of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s manifesto,” PM Imran said.
Earlier, the decision to build five million houses was taken in a meeting chaired by the prime minister Imran Khan on October 5.

The meeting decided that the five million houses will be completed in two phases as 2.5 million houses will be constructed in each phase.
PM Imran directed to complete the project in the given period. The meeting pondered over the construction of houses on Malaysian model houses.According to policy, the houses will be comprised of three, five and seven marla and will be provided to the citizen on 15 to 20 years installments.
Imran Khan said that provision of five million housing, equipped with all basic facilities, provision of clean water and regularization of slums is a foremost priority of the Government.Prime Minister directed the committee to finalize its recommendations regarding formulation of a comprehensive plan of action with delineated timelines within two weeks for early rollout of the Housing Program.

129,ECP Summons Yousif Talpur Son Over Horse Trading Allegations,https://abbtakk.tv/en/ecp-summons-ppps-talpur-for-horse-trading-allegations/,"September 28, 2018","Karachi (September 28, 2018): Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday summoned Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) leader Taimur Talpur, who confessed to horse-trading in the Senate elections, on October 4.
According to the details, the Election Commission of Pakistan has sent out a notice summoning Nawab Muhammad Taimur Talpur in connection with his admission that a member of the parliament had sold their vote to the Pakistan People Party (PPP) in the Senate elections earlier this year.
During a fiery speech made on the floor of the Sindh Assembly on Thursday, Talpur had said: “The member who sold the vote to PPP during the Senate election is still sitting in the assembly.”

Summoning Talpur to appear before the commission on October 4, the ECP’s order said that a notice had been taken over the allegations levelled by him.
According to a statement, the ECP further said that the verdict on the issue would be announced in the absence of the PPP leader, if he failed to appear before the tribunal.
Days after the controversy over horse-trading in the last Senate elections when lawmakers were accused of selling their votes, Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Nawab Taimur Talpur finally let the cat out of the bag when he admitted in the provincial assembly that his party had indulged in horse-trading. On Thursday, in a startling revelation, PPP lawmaker Taimur Talpur had confessed to horse-trading in the Senate elections in the huddle of the Sindh Assembly.
Taimur said, “Senate polls witnessed horse-trading. The member who sold his vote to Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was also sitting in the House”.“We made a commitment that we won t ever discuss this,” said Nawab Muhammad Taimur Talpur in the Sindh Assembly.
On the fourth day of the post-budget session, Talpur criticised members of the opposition for lashing out at the PPP’s policies. “They [opposition] are talking about corruption, loyalty and governance,” he began.
“We know about your credibility. I personally know one of your opposition members who sold his vote in the last Senate election. He is still sitting on the opposition benches.”
Talpur, who is the son of PPP MNA Nawab Yousuf Talpur, then lashed out at Abbasi. “Stop playing the devil’s game. You will be able to get the reserved seat for women again,” he quipped. This created uproar in the House, with members of the treasury and opposition screaming at each other.
Talpur, however, continued his speech and pointing a finger at Abbasi, said, “She is crying now, but I want to disclose here that it is the PPP that has given a government job to Abbasi’s husband.”All hell seems to break loose over the latest statement and after a heated exchange with the treasury members, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and GDA lawmakers walked out of the session. Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari, who was chairing the session, directed Talpur to stick to the budget, but the damage had already been done.
A ruckus erupted in Sindh Assembly soon after Talpur’s remarks as opposition’s lawmakers—who were left flabbergasted by the unforeseen disclosure—staged protest and urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Saqib Nisar to take suo motu notice and initiate a thorough probe into the matter.
Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had both protested and expressed severe reservations over clandestine act of horse-trading in the Senate polls.
Political and legal experts, however, believe that the ECP exercise of summoning politicians will bear no fruit as it will be difficult for the accusers to prove their allegations, particularly regarding the purchase of votes.

As the hearing went underway, DG FIA Bashir Memon submitted a request for an in-camera briefing. “There are some facts pertaining to the case which we want to apprise the court on separately,” Memon said.The chief justice then approved the DG FIA’s request and remarked, “All facts should be brought before the nation, no institution is above the law.”
The Case
On October 19, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a 141-page verdict, ordering legal proceedings against Gen (retd) Aslam Beg and Lt Gen (retd) Asad Durrani in a case filed 16 years ago by former air chief Air Marshal Asghar Khan.Khan, who passed away in January this year, was represented in the Supreme Court by renowned lawyer Salman Akram Raja.
Khan had petitioned the Supreme Court in 1996 alleging that the two senior army officers and the then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan had doled out Rs140 million among several politicians ahead of the 1990 polls to ensure Benazir Bhutto’s defeat in the polls.
The Islamic Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), consisting of nine parties including the Pakistan Muslim League, National Peoples Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, had won the 1990 elections, with Nawaz Sharif being elected prime minister. The alliance had been formed to oppose the Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan Peoples Party.In 1996, Khan had written a letter to the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Nasim Hassan Shah naming Beg, Durrani and Younis Habib, the ex-Habib Bank Sindh chief and owner of Mehran Bank, about the unlawful disbursement of public money and its misuse for political purposes.
The 2012 apex court judgment, authored by the then-Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Chaudhry, had directed the Federal Investigation Agency to initiate a transparent investigation and subsequent trial if sufficient evidence is found against the former army officers.
The investigation is yet to conclude.

Dr Faisal said the alleged killing of BSF soldier took place two days prior to the Indian announcement of its agreement to hold the bilateral meeting.
The spokesperson said Pakistan takes this opportunity to categorically reject these allegations once again and offered to conduct a joint investigation to establish the truth.
Secondly, the postage stamps mentioned in the Indian statement were issued before the 25th July 2018 elections, as a result of which the Government of Prime Minister Imran Khan assumed office.The stamps highlight the gross and systematic human rights violations in Indian Occupied Kashmir, which were extensively documented also in a comprehensive report issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as late as June 2018.
Dr Faisal said Pakistan believes by its ill-considered cancellation of the meeting, India has once again wasted a serious opportunity to change the dynamics of the bilateral relationship and put the region on the path of peace and development.

“Children born in Pakistan have the right to be called Pakistani,” the premier asserted. “Several people have been living in Karachi for decades without any nationality,” he lamented.

Electoral College of President of Pakistan
The Electoral College of Pakistan is formed by a joint sitting of the six leading political bodies in Pakistan:
the Senate of Pakistan,
the National Assembly of Pakistan,
the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab,
the Provincial Assembly of Sindh,
the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan and
the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Paktunkhwa
The President of Pakistan is chosen by an electoral college, in Pakistan. According to Article 41(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, this electoral college consists of the Senate, the National Assembly of Pakistan, and the Provincial Assemblies of the four provinces. Members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies are directly elected by the people in competitive multi-party elections. Members of the Senate are indirectly elected by the provincial assemblies.Electoral System
The President of Pakistan is indirectly elected by the Electoral College of Pakistan – a joint sitting of the Senate, National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies. Each elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by members of Parliament equals the total number of votes cast by provincial legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller provinces.
The number of votes cast in a Provincial Assembly in favor of each candidate shall be multiplied by the total number of seats in the Provincial Assembly for the time being having the smallest number of seats and divided by the total number of seats in the Provincial Assembly in which the votes have been cast.
The constitution further states that election to the office of President must be held no earlier than sixty days and no later than thirty days before the expiration of the term of the incumbent president. If assemblies are not present, the constitution allows the election of president to be delayed thirty days after the general election.So that each province has an equal vote, all provincial assemblies are given exactly 65 votes in the electoral college. This mean that the each member of the Punjab Assembly has 65/370 = 0.176 votes, each member of the Sindh Assembly has 65/168 = 0.387 votes, each member of the KPK Assembly has 65/124 = 0.524 votes and each member of the Balochistan Assembly has 65/65 = 1 vote.
The President is a ceremonial post, head of state, and merely a figurehead with the executive powers granted to Prime Minister, by the Constitution. The Constitution states that a presidential candidate must be a Muslim men or women, not less than 45 years of age, and a Member of the National Assembly can contest the Presidential election.
The constitution further states that election to the office of President will not be held earlier than sixty days and not later than thirty days before the expiration of the term of the President in office.

Opposition parties except for Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) decided to field Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman for the post of the country’s president.
Maulana Fazl also submitted his nomination papers for the presidential election run at the IHC.
Earlier, Pakistan Peoples’ Party co-chairman Asif Zardari expressed displeasure ‘over the role of MMA President Maulana Fazlur Rehman’ during presidential elections.
PPP has fielded Aitzaz Ahsan, while the opposition parties nominated Maulana Fazlur Rehman as their joint candidate against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Arif Alvi.
PPP had requested MMA chief to persuade PML-N president over Ahsan’s nomination, who met Shehbaz Sharif Sunday but failed to convince him.Surprisingly, the opposition parties nominated Fazlur Rehman which surprised the PPP.
Earlier on Monday, talking to media in Islamabad, the chief of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and MMA president Fazlur Rehman expressed hope that PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari would reconsider his decision and have his party vote for him in the September 4 presidential election, despite increasing rift among the opposition parties.
Soon after senior PPP leaders blamed the PML-N and the media for the growing fissures within the opposition ‘alliance’, and seemed all but resigned to not reaching a consensus over a presidential candidate, Rehman — the opposition’s presidential nominee — said he would try and convince Zardari to back him.

“The PPP did not vote in the prime minister’s elections, which resulted in Imran Khan becoming the PM by four votes,” Rehman said in a press conference in Islamabad. “The act of dividing up the opposition is not popular in the public.
“It will be our effort to take him (Zardari) in confidence and convince him to reconsider his decision so that a joint candidate could contest.”
The JUI leader said he “would like to meet Zardari today” to convince him to withdraw PPP nominee Aitzaz Ahsan’s candidacy in his favour.
Rehman said he and PML-N both “wanted the opposition’s prime minister candidate to be from the PPP.“However, the PPP people themselves said that the PM candidate should be from the PML-N. When a consensus was reached, then [the PPP] decided not to vote, which dispersed the opposition, and turned our hope — our decision to go into the parliament and turn the tables — into disappointment and despair.”
“We would not want to give the same disappoint to our members once again,” he added. “A joint position on this issue should be presented.”
With the grand opposition alliance failing to reach consensus on a single nominee, the PPP’s Ahsan and JUI-F’s Rehman emerged as the two candidates challenging Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidate Dr Arif Alvi’s bid for the head of state’s office in the September 4 election.
The failure of the opposition parties to field a joint candidate is expected to provide a virtual walkover to Dr Alvi, an MNA from Karachi.

The former cricketer was tipped as the ‘PM-in-waiting’ soon after the July 25 polls in which PTI won more seats than other political parties.
The party has already formed a government in its stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and an alliance with regional parties in the southwestern province of Balochistan. It is expected to form a coalition government in Punjab province, formerly a PML-N stronghold, in coming days. Sindh province remains in the hands of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).PTI candidates were also voted speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly this week, putting Khan in a strong position to carry forward his legislative agenda.
He will face myriad challenges including militancy, water shortages, and a booming population negating growth in the developing country, among others. Most pressing will be a looming economic crisis, with speculation that Pakistan will have to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

During the hearing, CJP directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to ensure foolproof arrangements with the assistance of Nadra.
The chief justice has ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan to make arrangements with the association of the NADRA to facilitate the overseas citizens to cast their vote through the internet.“Many congratulations to overseas Pakistanis today,” said CJP Nisar, saying that it would be the first time expat citizens will be casting their votes in local election.
If the pilot project of voting in the by-polls ends successfully, the court would allow the overseas Pakistan to use their right to vote in genral elections.
“If any conflict erupts during the by-polls due to the internet voting then separate the results of i-voting,” the top judge ruled, adding that the results, later, be presented in the parliament.
Earlier this week, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced that overseas Pakistanis would be able to take part in voting through the internet in the by-polls.The electoral body released its Internet Voting Task Force (IVTF) report on the voting right of the Pakistanis who work in foreign countries.
According to the report, pilot projects would be launched to enable the overseas countrymen to exercise their right to vote, adding that the process would not affect results of the by-polls, a private news channel reported. The pilot projects would be run at some polling stations instead of in all constituency.
A final decision to adopt the i-voting system would be taken after conducting several tests, which are crucial to detect the loopholes in the system, it said.The IVTF has been developed following the orders of the Supreme Court, the ECP said, adding that officials of NADRA, ECP’s Law and IT wings will be part of the task force.
By-elections on 11 general seats of the National Assembly, out of which nine have been vacated by those who won more than 1 seats, will be held within the next two months.

The CPP won in all 25 provinces and cities, Sik Bun Hok, chairman of the National Election Committee (NEC), said in a statement on Wednesday.
Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia for 33 years and said he wants to hold office for at least another 10, campaigned on promises of continued economic development, peace, and stability.

But rights groups said the July 29 vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to the prime minister.
Critics had condemned the vote as illegitimate and called for a boycott following the dissolution of the largest opposition political force – the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) – and a government crackdown against dissent.
The CPP pointed to 83 percent voter turnout as evidence that a boycott by the opposition failed, but allegations of voter intimidation and some 600,000 spoiled ballots undermined the claims.
Observers said that problems of credibility could trail the new government, which will be formed on September 5.

According to an official of ECP, the commission had already issued notification of returned candidates and under article 51 (d) of the constitution, independent candidates had to join any political party within three days of issuance of notification of successful candidates.He added every independent candidate had to submit an affidavit with the ECP regarding joining of any party. After this, the ECP allots special seats to political parties.
He said that under section 98 (3) of Elections Act, 2017, successful candidates had to submit details of their election expenses with the ECP within 10 days of holding of the general election. He said that the commission had fixed August 4 as the last date for submission of details of election expenses while it had fixed August 9 as the last date for submission of the affidavit from the independent candidates for joining any political party.
He dispelled this impression that the commission had been deliberately delaying the process and made it clear that the ECP will ensure timely completion of all procedure under the law.

183,Turkey’s Erdogan Calls On Turks To Buy Lira For National Battle,https://abbtakk.tv/en/turkeys-erdogan-calls-on-turks-to-buy-lira-for-national-battle/,"August 10, 2018","Istanbul (August 10, 2018): President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to exchange gold and hard currency into lira on Friday as part of a “national battle” against economic enemies he said have irreparably ruptured ties with Ankara.
The lira has long been falling on worries about Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy and worsening relations with the United States. That turned into a rout on Friday, with the lira diving as much as 18 percent at one point, the biggest one-day drop since Turkey’s 2001 financial crisis.
The lira, which has lost more than 40 percent this year, hit a new record low after Trump took steps to punish Ankara in a wide-ranging dispute. He said he had authorized higher tariffs on imports from the United States’ NATO ally, imposing duties of 20 percent on aluminum and 50 percent on steel.“The dollar cannot block our path. Don’t worry,” Erdogan told a crowd in the northeastern city of Bayburt.
“However, I say it once again from here, if there is anyone who has dollars or gold under their pillows, they should go exchange it for liras at our banks. This is a national, domestic battle,” he said.
“This will be my people’s response to those who have waged an economic war against us.”Erdogan’s comments offered no support for the currency, which fell as he spoke. A nearly hour-long presentation on Turkey’s new economic policy by Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak – Erdogan’s son-in-law – also did little to limit the currency’s free-fall.
Without naming countries, Erdogan said supporters of a failed military coup two years ago, which Ankara says was organized by a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, were attacking Turkey in new ways since his re-election two months ago.
“Some countries have engaged in behavior that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice,” Erdogan said. “Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging.”Turkey was facing artificial financial volatility, Erdogan said, and people should look to the “big picture” instead of foreign exchange prices.
Turkey had made important progress with other countries, he said, naming Iran, Russia, China and “some European countries”, Erdogan said, adding that increasing production, exports and employment was the best response to the country’s challenges.
“Don’t get too excited…You will not be able to topple this nation,” he told the crowd of supporters in Bayburt.

Earlier in the day, the ECP had announced re-polling after polls results showed less than 10% votes polled by female voters. PTI’s Yousafzai had emerged victorious in the July 25 election for the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa seat.

Women votes were less than 10 percent of the total polled votes in the constituency, it added.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Shaukat Yousafzai had emerged victor from PK-23 during the July 25 polls.
Earlier, the ECP had withheld Yousafzai’s victory notification.
According to records, 86,698 women were registered to vote from the constituency. However, only 3,505 women cast their votes in violation of ECP regulations.Before the elections, the ECP had said that results of any constituency would be declared invalid should the female turnout be lower than 10 per cent.
Only 3,500 out of 86,698 registered women voters used their right of franchise in the constituency while 66,000 out of 114,000 male voters participated in the democratic exercise, resulting in a 34% total turnout on July 25.
Earlier on July 22, the Election Commission of Pakistan warned elders and candidates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against any attempt to bar women from casting their votes.The commission cautioned against preventing women from voting that day, as it will bring into effect section 9 of the Elections Act 2017 which gives the ECP power to declare a poll void in that particular area.
The individuals found responsible will not only be fined for the crime but also put behind bars, said ECP.
According to the polling scheme, there are a total of 6.61 million female voters in the province.

Nawaz Sharif Shifted Back To Adyala Jail From PIMS
Earlier on July 31, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was shifted from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences to Adyala jail.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo is currently serving his prison sentence after being convicted in a corruption case by the accountability court.

NA-131 was snatched by PTI Chief  from PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique with a close margin in the July 25 elections.
The petition was filed by Imran Khan’s lawyer Babar Awan.
Imran bagged the seat by securing 84313 and the runner-up Saad Rafique secured 83633 votes with the difference of 780.
The LHC had also directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to restrain from issuing the notice of the success of the PTI chief until the process of the recount is completed. A Returning Officer had earlier dismissed the former railway’s minister’s plea of the recount of votes of the whole constituency.
The ECP then accepted Rafique’s application but only allowed scrutiny of rejected votes. However, Khan remained the winning candidate and the PML-N leader’s effort could not bear fruit, leading him to file a petition in the high court.Now challenging the LHC orders, the prime minister-in-waiting has prayed to the Supreme Court that Rafique’s petition was inadmissible and the high court’s order was in contradiction with the law and the Constitution and hence must be declared null and void.
Meanwhile, Khan’s party has expressed serious concerns over delays in announcing election results of the constituencies, currently being challenged at different levels.
Withholding results of almost 20 constituencies due to administrative or legal reasons is extremely inappropriate, said a statement issued by PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry. “Votes in 48 constituencies have already been recounted,” it added.

It will also send a positive message to the masses that their prime minister is not wasting public money on a life of luxuries and protocol ,the Gulf News reported.
Imran Khan has, in a number of interviews and press conferences, made it clear that he will neither stay in the PM House nor enjoy VVIP protocol after assuming office.The cricketer-turned politician has also vowed to ensure that his ministers and provincial chief ministers, where his party is in power, also follow principles austerity.
Pakistan’s PM House, though a relatively new building inaugurated by the former deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif only two decades ago when he was elected for a second term, is located on the main Constitution Avenue, covering an area of 135 acres, and luxuriously appointed.
The red-brick, heavily guarded building is modelled after the Mughal era palaces that housed royalty.
The PM House features five spacious lawns, a fruit orchard, a number of swimming pools, a banquet hall, media and committee rooms.There are also 10 servants quarters, residences for security officers, staff and members of the Public & Works Department and police.
Inside the PM House, around 50 protocol officers work in their offices.
The security budget of the complex is around Rs980 million, while Rs700 million are allocated for PM House staff.
Similarly, Rs150 million is spent annually on gifts for visiting dignitaries and guests, and Rs15 million on renovation and decoration.According to the PTI leadership, four universities equalling the area of Pakistan’s top varsity — Quaid-e-Azam University (spread over 35 acres in the capital) — can be set up in the PM House.

After the poll results were delayed, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had blamed a collapse in the Results Transmission System (RTS) for the unusual delay in the results on election day.
In a statement to the media, Rabbani lashed out at the electoral body. He called the constitution of a committee by ECP to probe into the RTS-collapse incident a ‘mere sham.’
“We reject the ECP Secretary Babar Yaqoob’s letter to constitute a probe committee,” Rabbani said. “Formation of a committee to probe into failure of the RTS system is a mere sham. The terms of reference (TORs) to form the committee are ambiguous and they ignore the main issue.”The PPP leader noted that TORs of the committee did not mention the statement of National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) that had said the system was functional.
The former Senate chairman further noted that the General Election 2018 had fallen prey to pre-poll rigging. “The collapse of RTS has raised questions on the entire election,” he said.
“The failure of RTS has given way to political instability at the centre,” Rabbani said. “We demand that the Senate be allowed to investigate the matter.”
On Thursday, ECP asked the Cabinet Division to constitute a committee to probe the malfunction of the software that was transmitting election results. The electoral body asked for technical representatives from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and National Telecom and Information Technology Security Board to be included in the committee.The commission further recommended that the committee should present a report on the matter within a month.
ECP secretary Babar Yaqoob on July 26 had said that the delay has not been caused by any ‘wicked conspiracy’ or pressure. He had stated that the poll results had been delayed due to the result transmission system malfunction while data was being entered into it.
Political parties, including the PPP and the PML-N, have since demanded a parliamentary commission into the matter while Nadra officials have denied that the RTS crashed on election eve. They instead went on to claim that it could have been the commission’s Result Management System (RMS) that may have crashed adding that Nadra received results from around 50 per cent of polling stations before the commission directed its officers to stop using RTS.
The ECP has continued to insist that the delay in announcement of results, which had cast doubts on the fairness of the entire electoral process, had been because of the fault in RTS.

203,GDA Protesting Province-Wide Against Alleged Rigging,https://abbtakk.tv/en/gda-protesting-province-wide-against-alleged-rigging/,"August 3, 2018","Karachi (August 03, 2018): Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) to protest province wid today against alleged rigging in the polls, which were held on July  25.
Earlier on August 01, the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) demanded re-election in Sindh in view of widespread rigging in July 25th polls and announced to hold province-wide protests on August 3.
The GDA’s chief Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi and Secretary General Ayaz Latif Palejo made the demand while addressing a press conference following a meeting to review the post-poll scenario in the province.Addressing the media, Pir Pagara also demanded the resignation of the chief election commissioner in view of the ECP’s failure to prevent the gross irregularities and rigging in the general elections.
He said although there were serious poll-related competition and dispute in Punjab as well but for unknown reasons the electoral mandate of the people of Sindh was stolen.
He alleged the votes polled in favour of the GDA candidates were rejected without any valid reason. He said the government officials facilitated rigging.Pagara said the pace of polling in parts of Sindh other than Karachi was deliberately slowed down and this serious issue was ignored despite several complaints lodged by the GDA.
He said the PPP candidates had to face humiliation during their electioneering campaign, while the GDA leaders were warmly received by the masses during the pre-poll period.
The GDA chief charged that even those PPP candidates who were considering to retire from the electoral race were able to poll over 80,000 votes.
He said the GDA would not block Imran Khan’s efforts to form the next federal government, but he must fulfil the promises made to the masses.
Pagara said the GDA wanted to give a strike call in Sindh to protest against the election rigging in the province but it gave preference to the larger national interest. He however said the courts would be moved against the rigging.The GDA chief said Imran Khan has promised to bring back the plundered wealth of the country stashed in bank accounts abroad.
He said mostly the corrupt bureaucrats are involved in looting money from the public exchequer. He said there is a large number of bureaucrats whose family members possess dual nationality. He claimed that for every 100 corrupt politicians, there existed a league of 1,000 corrupt bureaucrats.Speaking on the occasion, the GDA Secretary General Ayaz Latif Palejo said a province-wide protest would be held in every district of Sindh on August 3 at the call of GDA.
While in the second phase, main highways of the province would be blocked. In the last phase of the protest drive, a strike call could also be given.
Palejo said several key candidates of the alliance who were clearly winning the poll were deliberately defeated.
They included Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Jalal Mahmood Shah, Zulfiqar Mirza, Pir Sadruddin Shah Rashdi, and Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi. He said Form-45 containing election result of each polling stations have also not been given to the polling agents of the GDA’s candidates.

Posted by Abbtakk on Wednesday, August 1, 2018
Chaudry appeared in court today along with his counsel Kamran Murtaza.
As Justice Gulzar Ahmad, who headed the three-member bench, read out the court’s verdict, Chaudry was sentenced ’till the rising of the court’ — a relatively lenient and symbolic punishment which remains until the court is in session — and fined Rs0.1 million.
Following the conviction, Chaudry, who lost the July 25 General Election from Faisalabad’s NA-102 constituency, will be disqualified from holding public office for five years. Chaudry’s punishment lasted for a little over two hours as he remained confined inside Courtroom No. 3 since the bench continued hearing cases and even took a tea break in between.
His punishment was over once the bench concluded hearing cases.
Earlier on July 11, Supreme Court (SC) reserved verdict in the contempt of court case against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Talal Chaudhry.

A three-member bench, headed by Justice Gulzar Ahmed, resumed hearing the case, in which Kamran Murtaza, who is representing Chaudhry in a contempt case initiated against the then-state minister, on account of “derogatory and contemptuous speeches/statements” with regard to the court.

The defence counsel informed the court that the Supreme Court’s registrar had written a note to the Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Mian Saqib Nisar on February 1, 2018, stating that a video clip of his client was contemptuous and was creating hindrances in legal proceedings.
The note said that contempt proceedings against Chaudry should be taken up in compliance with Article 204. which deals with contempt of court against a high court or the Supreme Court, Murtaza informed the court.
“The note was presented on February 1, and an order was issued on the same day, along with a notice,” he said.
“However, my client, in the content on which the suo motu notice was taken had in fact said that disrespecting judicial mandate was the biggest contempt.”To this argument, Justice Ahmed said that he was unaware of the documents that the defence counsel had spoken about. “The court had taken up contempt proceedings on two speeches [delivered by Chaudry],” the judge observed.
“We are not aware of the documents that you have mentioned, nor aware where they have come from,” Justice Ahmed told the defence counsel.
Murtaza then responded by saying that the documents he had mentioned were sent to the chief justice by the registrar through a note. “Following the chief justice’s order, 22 speeches were collected,” the defence counsel contended.
Chaudry’s legal counsel further said that the proceedings against his client were taken up on the basis of two speeches that had a three-minute duration each. “The reasons for contempt were not listed in the notice,” he argued. The defence counsel further contended that only two of the 117 television channels were monitored. “According to Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) DG Operations Haji Adam, all of the 117 channels on air are monitored. But there is nobody in Pakistan who can take up so much work,” Murtaza said.
Responding to the defence counsel’s argument, Justice Ahmed said that there was definitely someone in Pakistan who was helping the country run effectively. Murtaza responded by saying that even PEMRA had not taken an immediate notice of both speeches of his client.
“The court will not take lead from PEMRA to reach a verdict; it will base its decision on the law,” said Justice Ahmed.
Background Of The Case
The court had reserved its verdict on the case on July 11 after beginning proceedings in February.
The Supreme Court had initiated contempt proceedings against Chaudry on account of “derogatory and contemptuous speeches/statements” with regard to the court, according to a notification issued on February 2.In his response to the contempt notice, Chaudhry had written that scandalising the court or doing anything that tended to bring the court into “hatred, ridicule or contempt” was “not even the last thing on the respondent’s mind.”
“Whatever has been said might have been taken into account without relevance to the context due to media reporting,” his response stated.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan directed his close aide Jahangir Khan Tarin to immediately contact Muttahida Qaumi Movement after it was reportedly asked by the PPP to choose between Sindh and federal governments.

According to the statement, over 120 EU observers oversaw “the opening, voting, counting and tabulation processes at 582 polling stations and tabulation centres in 113 constituencies of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakthunkhwa and Islamabad.”

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Friday, he said that results were still expected from several constituencies; however, this won’t damage the electoral process.
Gahler said that they do not have interest in the results but instead they have interest in the electoral process.
In its initial findings on this week s Pakistani parliamentary elections, the EU Election Observation Mission concluded that polling was relatively transparent, but raised the alarm on unfair pre-election practices.The EU observer chief went on to say that Pakistani military had not interfered in the voting process.
“On election day, polling was assessed as well conducted and transparent,” he said. “However, counting was somewhat problematic with staff not always following the procedures.”
“Candidates with large political appeal and financial means, the so-called “electables” were reported to often dominate the campaign. Uneven rules on campaign spending further undermined candidates’ equal opportunity,” the EU EOM observed.

“We were successful and we were given a mandate,” he said from his home in the capital Islamabad, adding in a conciliatory note that there would be “no political victimisation” of his opponents in the future.
The former all-rounder’s statement came after his supporters took to the streets to celebrate winning an election that opponents have said the military fixed for him.

The Election Commission of Pakistan has dismissed allegations of manipulation — blaming the delay on glitches in new, untested counting software — and said there would be a result by Friday.
International observers, including a European Union delegation, are due to give their preliminary assessments of the vote Friday, after rival parties, including the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), alleged “blatant” rigging.
Late Wednesday, the once-mighty PML-N, which had been in power since 2013, rejected the results and vowed it would mount a legal challenge.
Other major parties — including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which could prove kingmaker in a coalition government — have also alleged the count is being manipulated.

The delay in the results, an unofficial version of which had been expected late Wednesday, has forced election authorities to hold multiple press conferences to defend themselves.
“The election was conducted in a fair and free manner,” said secretary Babar Yaqoob on Thursday.
A PTI win would represent an end to decades of rotating leadership between the PPP and PML-N that was punctuated by periods of military rule.
Khan, who captained Pakistan to their cricket World Cup victory in 1992, campaigned on promises to end widespread graft while building an “Islamic welfare state”.

“Our observers visited as many as 300 polling stations in 87 constituencies and I have personally visited four polling stations. Though we will release our preliminary report on Friday and a detailed report will be released later after assessing the overall situation, there is improvement as compared to the previous election held in 2013,” he said while talking to reporters outside Ammar Khan Shaheed Model School for Boys in Sector G-10/3 on Wednesday.He said that as many as 50 recommendations were given by the mission after the 2013 elections, out of which 36 were implemented or included in the electoral law.
When asked that some political parties were complaining that they were not given a level playing field, Mr Gahler said that the mission could not get access for a month due to which it was mostly depending on media reports.
He said that according to his assessment, the army was deployed under a code of conduct and it was strictly following it.
Mr Gahler also visited a polling station and asked a number of questions from presiding officer Muhammad Yousuf, who is a faculty member at the Federal Urdu University.
Earlier, while visiting Islamabad Model College for Girls F-6/2, Mr Gahler said that as many as 60 EU observers were working across the country, apart from Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).“We have observed smooth polling and many of our recommendations seem to be implemented and the security situation seems improved. However, we condemn the incident of Quetta where people who were electing their future leadership was attacked,” he said.
“This is a deplorable and cowardly attack on a day when voters across Pakistan should be casting their ballots in a peaceful environment, without fear or hindrance,” said Mr Gahler.
“Violence must not undermine the elections and the democratic process. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, and the people of Pakistan,” he added.

Trump said he would consider Putin culpable because he’s Russia’s leader. I would because he’s in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country,” Trump said. “So certainly as the leader of the country you would have to hold him responsible.”Trump ultimately walked back the answer he gave at the joint news conference in Helsinki, and attributed his comments to a simple mistake.
“In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t,'” Trump said on Tuesday. He explained he had reviewed a transcript and video of his remarks. “The sentence should have been: ‘I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia,’ ” he said. “Sort of a double negative.”The White House was once again sent into clean-up mode Wednesday when Trump said “no” when a reporter asked him if Russia was still targeting the United States. Press secretary Sarah Sanders later claimed Trump was saying “no” to answering questions, not to whether the Russians are targeting the US.
When pressed in his Wednesday interview on whether his acceptance of the US intelligence analysis meant that he thought Putin lied when denying any Russian involvement, Trump said he “didn’t want to get into whether or not he’s lying.”“I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted,” Trump said. He said his message to Putin warning against future interference was “very strong” during their meeting Monday.“I let him know we can’t have this. We’re not going to have it. And that’s the way it’s going to be,” Trump said.
Trump also said once again that he wants to sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election and Russians’ ties to the Trump campaign. “I’ve always wanted to do an interview, because look, there’s been no collusion,” Trump said.

313,Prison or Gallows Can Not Stop My Feet For Struggle: Nawaz,https://abbtakk.tv/en/whether-jail-or-hanging-couldnt-stop-nawaz-sharif/,"July 11, 2018","London (July 11, 2018): The former prime minister Nawaz Sharif reiterated his stance over his return to Pakistan and said that prisons or execution could not stop his feet for the struggle of honuor to vote. He said that he would not stop now whether he was taken to prison or gallows.
“I am going to Pakistan as my country is in hot waters. I am going there to fulfill the promise of honour for vote,” he said while addressing party convention in London.

“These people have not given a prison sentence to my daughter, they have given the sentence to every daughter of this nation,” he said, amidst chants of “Wazir-i-azam [prime minister] Nawaz Sharif!”
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif said that he was returning to the country leaving his wife Kulsoom in Allah’s protection.
The former premier said that he wished to see his wife opening her eyes again, requesting the nation to pray for her recovery.Sharif claimed that the accountability judge had said that no evidence of corrupt practices was found against him.
“When they could not find anything for a year, they looked for the iqama, and said that I did not take an imaginary salary from my son,” he alleged, adding that he was sentenced in the corruption reference even though no corruption was proven against him.
“The problem here is that they have found two different standards of justice — one standard is for me, the other is for the ladlas [favourites].”
He said that he was returning “despite seeing a prison cell in front of him.”“I am returning to fulfill the promise of giving respect to vote,” Nawaz said, adding that he would not abandon his nation.
Speaking of the Avenfield reference verdict, the former premier noted that it was written in the verdict that he had been absolved of corruption charges.
“It had to be written in the verdict that no evidence of corruption could be found against me,” he said.
“Is there any Pakistani whose three generations had to face such sort of accountability?”
Nawaz said the people of Pakistan once again saw the “real face” of justice. “Having searched in several countries of the world, it had to be written that there was no evidence of corruption [against me].”He maintained that he respected every institution of Pakistan, noting that he made the country a nuclear-capable state.
“I have immense respect for ‘Ghazis’ and ‘Shuhada’ of Pakistani forces in my heart,” the former premier said. “The martyrs sacrificed their today for our tomorrow.”
He said that they greatly loved these ‘Ghazis’ and ‘Shuhada’, and they could sacrifice everything for these sons of the soil.
Nawaz, however, said that he had set out bearing the flag of “give respect to vote.”
“I’m coming to pay off the debt of the nation that thrice elected me the prime minister,” he said.The former premier said that if they had to stay alive and progress, then all this had to be changed. “Not only all this needs to be changed, but should be changed soon for we do not have much time.”
He said that they were getting this chance for a change after two weeks, adding that the forthcoming election would decide their fate.
“Every Pakistani will have to hold his vote in hand and think,” Nawaz said, adding that he would address the people at Lahore airport on July 13.
He urged the masses to also set out of the homes on July 25 and announce such a verdict making the world pay a tribute to them.“My daughter Maryam is also going to prison with me,” the former premier said, adding that he was ready to face any difficulty or hardship for the sake of country.
“Brave masses should set out of their homes like lions; Shehbaz will lead the crowd to [Lahore] airport,” he said.
“The dictator, who imprisoned judges, is roaming free, and no one has the courage to bring him and put on a trial,” Nawaz criticised.
He said that disrespect of vote had made a mockery of the country. “Herding the masses like a pack of cattle is unacceptable.”
The former premier said that July 25 election was going to be the biggest referendum.“How did the petition, which was discarded after being labelled as useless, become sacred,” he questioned.
“What action was taken against Wajid Zia, who issued a tender worth several millions to relatives in the name of investigations?”
Nawaz is currently in London to tend to his ailing wife. He is expected to return to the country on July 13, after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison by an accountability court in Avenfield properties reference against the Sharif family.
Last week, the former premier was sentenced to a total of 11 years in prison and slapped a £8 million fine (Rs1.3 billion) in the Avenfield properties reference, while his daughter Maryam was sentenced to eight years with a £2 million fine (Rs335 million).
Additionally, Nawaz’s son-in-law Capt (retd) Safdar has been given a one year sentence without any fine.

The Caretaker Minister said foolproof security will be ensured during the poll keeping in view the threats.  He said full coordination should be provided to Election Commission of Pakistan in this regard.
Mohammad Azam Khan advised the political parties to avoid leveling personal allegations during the election campaign and cooperate with the government for security.On the other hand, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Justice (R) Sardar Mohammad Raza Khan on Tuesday expressed his annoyance at the monetary impact of repeated changes in ballot papers due to high court’s rulings.
A five-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner was hearing a petition filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for the allotment of the party’s electoral symbol, tiger, to Maryam Nawaz’s covering candidates. PML-N lawyers had also filed a similar petition for NA-146 Pakpattan to Rana Zahid’s covering candidate, his son Rana Iradat, after the former was disqualified to contest polls from the constituency. Ali Pervaiz is contesting the polls from NA-127 constituency and Irfan Khokhar will represent PML-N from PP-173 constituency, following Maryam’s disqualification from contesting the polls by an accountability court.
As the hearing went under way, PML-N lawyers appeared before the bench to present their arguments. They contended that Subsection 3 of Election Act 2017’s Clause 4 dictates that the covering candidate is allotted the party’s electoral symbol.The lawyers informed the court that names of both covering candidates were written on Form 33 submitted to the ECP by Maryam from both constituencies. The pleaded the electoral body to review the Form 33 from both NA-127 and PP-173 constituencies.
“Till when will Form 33 be changed?” remarked a member of the Sindh division of ECP.
Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Khan remarked about the expense involved in the printing of ballot papers. “The printing of ballot papers commenced on July 1; watermarked ballot papers are very expensive. Why don’t the high courts consider the burden [of monetary expenditure] on the commission,” he stated.The CEC further noted that the printing process will not be completed if the trend of high court ruling continues. “If a few similar rulings are announced, we will run out of ballot papers,” he said.
The electoral body then reserves its verdict on the PML-N petition.
Later, the ECP-bench announced the verdict, accepting PML-N’s petition. The electoral body accepted PML-N’s request to review Form 33 from NA-127, PP-173, and NA-146.
ECP Completes Necessary Arrangements For Polls:
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on July 09, said that the commission had made all necessary logistic arrangements for ensuring to hold the upcoming general election on July 25 in a smooth and an organized manner.
The holding of elections which is considered to be a biggest logistic activity in the country required a comprehensive strategy to deal all matters related with the logistic support, ECP’s Spokesperson Altaf Khan said.
“The logistic exercises are of two kinds including sensitive and non-sensitive.
Sensitive logistic exercise involves ballot papers while non-sensitive includes deployment of official staff, formation of District Monitoring Teams (DMT), bags, pens, indelible ink and stamps in bulk,” Altaf informed.

The former Punjab chief minister was speaking to reporters in Lahore on Friday shortly after accountability court judge Mohammad Bashir announced the verdict handing Nawaz Sharif a 10-year prison term and an £8 million fine in the Avenfield properties reference. The court also gave Sharif’s daughter Maryam a seven-year prison sentence and a £2 million fine, rendering her disqualified to contest the 2018 general elections in Pakistan.

Shehbaz Sharif said that Pakistani Nation and PML-N as party denounced the decision and rejected it.
“It was a verdict of a court, however people will announce a real decision on July 25,” he said adding that the verdict was against the law and has full of shortcomings.
“I will personally go to all corners of Pakistan and tell the people about this injustice and then on July 25 after saying fajr prayers, the people will cast their votes and give their ultimate verdict,” Shahbaz announced during the press conference.He appealed to the workers to stay calm and registered their protest peacefully.
“This will be remembered as a black day in history,” Shahbaz said while adding that Nawaz appeared before the accountability court 109 times.
“They were calling him everyday. They even spoke of holding hearings on weekends,” Shahbaz said, while adding that there are other cases in which corruption has been proven in black and while and yet no verdicts were announced against the culprits.
He termed an accountability court decision to send his brother, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to jail as unjust and “a dark chapter in history”.He said that voters will make their decision on July 25th. “We will adopt all legal options available for justice,” he said.
He recounted incidents when NAB dismissed a case against another political figure on the grounds that original documents were not available. He accentuated that in Nawaz Sharif’s case, however, the decision has been announced against him even though “there was not even a single document of evidence proving Nawaz Sharif’s ownership, or without even his name being in Panama [papers].”
He lamented that his brother’s wife Begum Kulsoom Nawaz was extremely ill but there was absolutely no regard given even to her. He added that the public’s court and God’s court were bigger and he, along with PML-N, would be taking their case to those courts.“The PML-N party rejects (this) unjust verdict. There are many legal loopholes in the judgment. No written proofs were provided in this case,” he added.
“Who gave you motorways? Who made Pakistan a nuclear power? Who brought CPEC investments to this coutry? Who ended loadshedding? Who was the reason behind the economic uplift of Gwadar? The credit goes to Nawaz Sharif.”
Shehbaz, who succeeded his brother as the president of the PML-N party after the latter s ouster by the Supreme Court over undecalred income, also lashed out at the anti-graft watchdog over its treatment of the Sharif family.“Mian Sahib and his daughter appeared before the court at least 109 times. NAB, in the past, has given clean chits to those facing corruption cases.”

A two-judge bench of the apex court heard Rind’s plea against the BHC’s decision to disqualify him on the grounds that he possessed a fake degree and had a murder case against him.
Rind’s lawyer told the court, “I had intentionally written in the nomination papers that the PTI Balochistan president holds a Faculty of Arts (FA) degree.”
Claiming that Rind’s previous nomination papers stated that he held a Master’s degree, his counsel added, “I made a conscious decision to not mention that.”
Further, the PTI Balochistan president’s counsel denied the chief justice’s suggestion that there seems to be “some dishonesty” behind the decision.“I was not being dishonest when I hid the degree certificate,” he said.
Regarding the murder case against him, Rind’s lawyer stated, “He has been granted bail in the case and I have submitted a copy of it.”
The court subsequently set aside BHC’s decision.Earlier on July 03, Balochistan High Court maintained disqualification verdict of PTI’s Provincial President, Yar Muhammad Rind.
During the hearing, the BHC declared that the decision by the RO and appellate tribunal would stand and rejected his plea seeking permission to contest election from PB-17 and NA-260 Kachi/Jhal Magsi.

He further alleged, “The urban population of Sindh was made to appear less during the census.”Claiming that he filed a petition against the result of the recent population census, Kamal said, “The chief justice of Pakistan heard my arguments and fixed September 10 as the date for the hearing of the case.”
Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Saqib Nisar on Friday approved on Kamal’s appeal against the registrar’s dismissal of its petition related to the recent population census in Karachi.
After a brief hearing, PSP’s appeal was accepted by the chief justice and the registrar office’s objections were dismissed.
In his decision, Chief Justice Nisar observed that the hearing on the petition will be held after the general election, due on July 25, as any proceedings prior to that could impact the polls.

The fire started hours after a number of judges were officially tasked with carrying out the manual process of recounting the votes from May’s election.
The office of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi released a statement Sunday calling the incident a “plot to sabotage the country and its democratic process.”We will take the necessary steps and will strike with an iron fist anyone who wishes to destabilize the security of the country and its citizens,” the statement read.
Iraq’s civil defense force was able to contain the fire and stop it from spreading to the main warehouse housing the majority of the ballots, according to General Saad Maan, spokesman for Iraq’s Interior Ministry.
In a video sent to the media, Maan is shown pointing to the main warehouse and saying that the fire was contained before reaching it.
A thick cloud of black smoke billowed in the background as Maan showed the complex, which contains a number of smaller warehouses.
Iraqi security forces and firefighters gather as smoke rises from the blaze.
It was not immediately clear what caused the fire, the extent of the damage, or whether it would affect the planned recount.

Nisar, one of the most senior PMl-N leader, announced his decision during a corner meeting held at Adiala Road on Monday.

“The party [PML-N] has given tickets to political orphans,” Nisar said, adding, “There are 10 faults in the PTI but 100 [faults] in the PML-N.”
He said that it is time for him to work even harder, as he would be contesting the election as an independent candidate.
“The party [PML-N] has issued tickets to political orphans,” he alleged. “I will contest the election as independent; there is a need for even more hard work now.”
The PML-N stalwart used the occasion to target his party’s leadership, saying: “These Sharifs will not able to show their faces anywhere if I decide to open my mouth.”
He suggested that he had been keeping mum on matters he did not disclose because of his 34-year association with the Sharif brothers.
“An opponent of Aurat Raj (Women’s Rule) has imposed his daughter on the party,” he said, in an apparent reference to PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz.Asked by party workers whether he was considering joining the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Nisar opted for a vague response: “You focus on the elections, [I] will decide what is better.”
The PML-N stalwart did, however, say that while there might be 10 faults within the PTI, “there are more than 100 flaws in the N-league.”
He also dismissed demands from some PML-N leaders that he appears before the party’s parliamentary board to qualify for a ticket, saying there was no precedent of the party’s senior-most leaders sitting in an interview for the ticket.
“I neither expect their [PML-N] ticket nor do I need it,” he said.
Political aides of Chaudhry Nisar earlier filed the nomination papers for constituencies NA-63, NA-59, PP-10 and PP-12.
On Sunday, the former interior minister alleged that a ‘comical drama’ was being staged by PML-N leadership to not issue him party tickets for the forthcoming polls.
Party leader Nawaz Sharif and ex-Punjab chief minister Shehbaz Sharif were reported to be at loggerheads regarding issuing a party ticket to Nisar.

Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif through his counsel submitted his reply in the Asghar Khan case in the Supreme Court on Saturday.
Nawaz, in the four-page reply, states that he never received Rs3.5 million from Lt. General (retd) Asad Durrani or under his instructions from his representatives as a donation to spend on the general election campaign of 1990.Nawaz also denied receiving an amount in the sum of Rs3.5 million and Rs2.5 million from Younus Habib or under his instructions.
The reply adds that Nawaz Sharif has already recorded his statement on October 14, 2015, before the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) inquiry committee.
Sirajul Haq Submits Reply
Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq also submitted an affidavit on behalf of his party denying allegations of receiving money from the ISI for the 1990 elections.
“JI had not received any kind of amount from ISI or any other resource in 1990 and JI had become the part of the case voluntarily in 2007,” he said in his reply adding that he was ready to present himself before any kind of commission or investigation.
Earlier this week, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had directed 31 respondents including Nawaz Sharif to submit written replies by June 9 in the Asghar Khan case. Nawaz, who failed to appear before the bench hearing the case, was allowed to be represented by a lawyer.
Asghar Khan Case:
In 1996, Air Marshal Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC of Pakistan, accusing the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of doling out money to a group of politicians in the 1990s.
The case was initiated by the air marshal after Benazir Bhutto’s interior minister, retired general Naseerullah Babar, had disclosed in the National Assembly in 1994 how the ISI had disbursed funds to purchase the loyalty of politicians and public figures so as to manipulate the 1990 elections, form the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), and bring about the defeat of the PPP.
16 years after the petition was filed, the SC in its judgement — penned by then chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry — ruled that the 1990 general elections had been polluted by dishing out Rs140 million to a particular group of politicians only to deprive the people of being represented by their chosen representatives.
The court had, however, thrown the ball back to the then PPP government by directing it to take necessary action under the Constitution and law against former army chief Beg and former director general of ISI Durrani for their role in facilitating the group of politicians and political parties to ensure their success against their rivals in the 1990 elections.

It appeared that a person, who violated the law and ran away from justice, had special privileges, Rabbani slammed. The PPP senator noted that a special court had declared Musharraf an absconder on May 2016. He accused the former president of misleading the court on the pretext of his deteriorating health.Rabbani said that it was worrisome that a person, who was declared an absconder and had warrants issued for him from different courts, had been allowed to submit his nomination papers.
“It is a matter of grave concern that a person who has been declared an absconder and whose warrants of arrest had been issued by various courts had been allowed to file his nomination papers, conditionally,” the statement reads.On Thursday, the Supreme Court, while hearing Musharraf’s review petition against his disqualification by the Peshawar High Court, ordered the former president to appear before it, assuring that he would not be arrested.
“We will pass an order ensuring authorities do not arrest the former president before his appearance in court,” Chief Justice Saqib Nisar had said.
He had also remarked, “I will ask returning officers to accept Musharraf’s nomination papers but conditional to the final verdict on his appeal.”

The nominees were scrutinised during a meeting of the ECP, chaired by the chief election commissione and most of the members favoured Marri for the top slot.
After the two sides failed to reach a consensus, the matter was passed on to the parliamentary committee of Balochistan. However, the government-nominated members boycotted the committee meeting on Wednesday after former chief minister Abdul Qudus Bizenjo described the opposition leader as controversial.Former chief ministers Dr Abdul Malik Baloch and Nawab Sanaullah Zehri had reached the assembly secretariat for talks, but the others did not show up, resulting in the cancellation of the meeting.
“We are acting in line with the Constitution, but the former government is creating hurdles,” Zehri had said. “Bizenjo wants amendments to the Constitution to make way for him to become chief minister for life. Balochistan will not entertain any more jokes.”
He had added that Bizenjo’s decision to boycott the meeting showed his non-seriousness towards a serious issue. “We have, therefore, decided to send our shortlisted names to the Election Commission of Pakistan.”Marri pledged that free and fair elections would be his top priority as the caretaker CM of the province.
“With the support of the people I’m hopeful that the polls will be carried out impartially and in a peaceful manner,” he added.  “I’ll try my level best to ensure a high voter turnout on polling day,” he said.
“I want to thank the ECP for placing their trust in me to carry out this task,” he said.

“Nawaz Sharif was with Hamid Gul during ‘changa manga’ episode He was also one of the central characters of Asghar Khan case. All the alien species had been supportive of him.”

Khawaja Asif was given warm welcome at his arrival at Daska. He urged the masses to vote for Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the upcoming general elections.
It may be recalled that on April 26, Islamabad High Court declared Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif disqualified  in a case filed by PTI leader Usman Dar.
After the apex court decision on Article 62 (1) F, the disqualification of the foreign minister will be for lifetime.
The larger bench of IHC headed by Athar Minallah along with Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani announced a unanimous verdict , as the notice in this connection was issued for all concern parties.

The written judgement from the court stated “We declare that the Respondent [Asif] was not qualified to contest the General Election of 2013 from NA-110 as he did not fulfill the conditions described under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, read with section 99(1)(f) of the Act of 1976.”
“The Registrar of this Court was directed to send certified copy of this judgment to the Election Commission for de-notifying the Respondent as Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan. A copy was also directed to be sent to the Speaker of National Assembly of Pakistan for information,” it adds.
It is worth mentioning here that Dar had lost elections to Asif in May-2013. The PTI leader moved court against Asif relying on apex court’s landmark July-28 judgment pertaining to receivable salary under which the SC had ousted ex-premier Nawaz Sharif.
Dar—in his petition—alleged that Asif was entitled to draw a salary which fell under category of receivable asset; however, since he did not declare it in the nomination form while contesting the 2013 general elections from NA-110, he did not qualify to remain a member of the National Assembly.On April 11, the three-member IHC larger bench reserved the judgment after hearing arguments of both the sides.
Dar has sought disqualification of Khawaja Asif contending that he had concealed that he was an Iqama holder, legal advisor of a company in the UAE and his recent labour card was issued on June 29, 2017.
Dar had cited Asif, the Election Commission of Pakistan and secretary National Assembly as respondents.
Dar had contended that Asif had been a full-time employee of an Abu Dhabi-based company Int Mech & Elec Co LLC (IMECL) since July 2, 2011.The petitioner has attached some documents with the petition saying that against his employment, Asif was entitled to receive 35000 UAE Dirham as salary and 15000 AED as monthly allowances that is being received and currently receivable being an MNA as well as foreign minister of the country.
He contended that Asif never disclosed this source of income in Pakistan and he was no more ‘Sadiq’ and ‘Ameen’.

In a statement today, Nawaz asked whether Zardari was so innocent that he got duped by him [Nawaz]. He claimed that he sent a message disliking Zardari’s remarks during his ‘anti-establishment’ speech in 2015.
He added that he then cancelled a planned meeting with Zardari the next day.
Former PM said that Asif Ali Zardari wanted to give weightage to “others”, he warned Asif Zardari not to manipulate history and avoid allegations.

The PML-N supremo then advised the PPP leader not to distort history and avoid mudslinging.
He wondered why Zardari didn’t make public his claim that he [Nawaz] advised him to make the remarks.
“Why is Zardari now speaking the ‘truth’ after three years,” he asked, asserting that being opposed to former president General (Retd) Pervez Musharraf shouldn’t translate into being against an institution.
“To become a part of the government, our conditions were Musharraf’s impeachment, restoration of the deposed judges and abolition of the 17th Amendment,” Nawaz shared.
Zardari should remember he came to meet me in Raiwind along with a national political figure, recalled Nawaz.Nawaz claimed he rejected Zardari’s proposal to condone Musharraf’s action by an act of Parliament, adding that Zardari is aware that he has nothing to do with the NAB action against Dr Asim Hussain and other Sindh government members.
“Zardari said he was acting on my directions. Now he should tell the public whose puppet he is,” said Nawaz.
The three-time prime minister then advised Zardari to read the writing on the wall and focus on the upcoming elections and refrain from mudslinging.
He said Zardari wanted the endorsement from the parliament of all the steps taken by Pervez Musharraf, which he rejected.He said that Federal Govt had no role in raids of NAB in Sindh, raids were conducted on the orders of then DG Rangers Sindh.
Nawaz Sharif said masses are irked now by the politics, which Asif Ali Zardari is doing now, the vote has to be given preference, Nawaz added.
Zardari had claimed on Monday that Nawaz had taken every opportunity to discredit him by making him fight with the establishment while he himself extended a hand of friendship towards them.
The former president said that Nawaz had encouraged him to fight the establishment but he shook hands with them.

He added, “Nawaz will suffer now, I will not join hands with him anymore.”
“We used to think that Nawaz was very innocent, but he is far more cunning and opportunistic than we thought,” Zardari said, as per sources.
“Nawaz has sold us out on every occasion and we were duped by him at all times. I wanted to maintain social relations with Nawaz but he took advantage of my goodwill.”Asif Zardari said we supported Nawaz Sharif, when govt filed treason case against Pervez Musharraf, NS assured not to let Musharraf go abroad, but later he allowed him to flee away, Zardari added.
Commenting upon his ‘brick for brick’ speech, Zardari said he made the statement after being duped by Nawaz.In a heated speech on June 16, 2015, Zardari had warned the establishment not to overstep its mandate. “Don’t disturb us or we will also respond to a brick with a brick,” he had said, adding “there is a limit to everything. Do not interfere in matters where you have no authority.”Zardari explained that Nawaz took advantage of the statement and tried to set the record straight with former army chief General Raheel Sharif.
Nawaz also ordered organisations such as National Accountability Bureau among others to take action in Sindh, Zardari claimed.
In his June 16, 2015 speech, Zardari had criticised the establishment and his political opponents warning them that the day his party took to the streets, not just Sindh’s, but the entire country’s roads will be blocked.

Late last month, in a joint press conference with Bahadurabad faction leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui at the party’s Bahadurabad office, Sattar had said that the Bahadurabad office was the joint home of party workers despite their differences. He had added that all workers in PIB and Bahadurabad were part of MQM.He also noted that the two groups shared an ideological bond despite their disagreements.

499,WB Expects Higher Expenditures This Year Due To Election,https://abbtakk.tv/en/wb-expecting-higher-expenditures-this-year-due-to-election/,"April 16, 2018","Islamabad(April 16, 2018): World Bank expects expenditures would be higher because of the election year while more draw down in foreign exchange reserves expected because of the ballooning current account deficit but it would partly be offset due to higher foreign direct investment expected to increase owing to CPEC related project.
The twice a year report prepared by the World Bank under the theme of South Asia Economic Forum which narrated that upcoming national election in 2018 may affect the reform momentum and macroeconomic policy. Slower progress in much-need reforms would weaken growth prospects and discourage private investment, the report said.The World Bank said that on the supply side, the impetus to growth is projected to come from the services and the industrial sectors. On the demand side, acceleration would be driven by public and private consumption, aided by a moderate increase in investment.
The pressure on the current account is expected to persist as the trade deficit will remain elevated during FY2018 and FY2019. This situation can potentially become unsustainable in absence of corrective policy measures. However, exports are expected to recover during Fiscal Year 2018 and Fiscal Year 2019 due to an easing of supply-side factors. Imports, after strong growth of 17.7 percent in FY2017, are expected to grow at a slower pace in FY2018 and FY2019.
Remittances will continue to partly finance the current account deficit. It is also expected that FDI flows will strengthen due to the accelerated implementation of CPEC projects. However, capital and financial flows during FY2018 and FY2019 will only partly finance the current account deficit, which will result in a drawdown of reserves during these two years.
Fiscal slippages are expected to continue through the election cycle, which will result in a widening of the fiscal deficit during FY2018. This increase in the fiscal deficit is primarily driven by a slower increase in government tax revenues (both federal and provincial) and a sharper increase in expenditures.An adjustment in the fiscal position in FY2019 after the election will help in curtailing the fiscal deficit.
Inflation, after remaining moderate during FY2017, is expected to rise in FY2018 and FY2019. Inflation is expected to rise due to higher domestic demand pressures and a slight increase in international oil prices.
Macroeconomic risks have increased substantially during FY2017. The external balance is particularly vulnerable given the persistent current account deficit, affecting the country reserve position. Improving the external balance hinges upon a revival in exports, a slowdown in imports, and stable remittance flows. In absence of any of these factors, the persistent current account deficit will put further pressure on already dwindling reserves.
The fiscal position is also expected to deteriorate during the election cycle, which would affect debt trends and maintain debt at the current high level. The quitting of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has enhanced political risks and created some policy uncertainty.

The victory would add seven more years to Aliyev’s 15-year tenure.
The national elections commission said that with 65 percent of the ballots counted, President Ilham Aliyev had received 86 percent of the vote in an early presidential election.The National Council of Democratic Forces, an opposition group, claimed late Wednesday that only about 15 percent of the electorate voted, while Azerbaijan’s elections commission reported the turnout at nearly 75 percent.
In a statement, the opposition group also alleged widespread violations including people voting multiple times.56-year-old President, has led Azerbaijan since 2003. He succeeded his father, Geidar Aliyev, who ruled Azerbaijan first as Communist Party boss and then as a post-Soviet president for the greater part of three decades.
Like his father before him, the son has cast himself as a custodian of stability, an image that resonates with many in a nation where memories of the chaos and turmoil that accompanied the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union are still fresh.Since Aliyev won the last election in 2013, Azerbaijan’s constitution has been amended to extend the presidential term from five to seven years. Aliyev’s critics denounced the 2016 plebiscite as effectively cementing a dynastic rule.
Aliyev has allied the majority Shia Muslim nation of almost 10 million with the West, helping to protect its energy and security interests and to counterbalance Russia’s influence in the strategic Caspian region.

Addressing a seminar regarding Asma Jahangir, the chief justice said that there is no way for the elections to be delayed as per the constitution of Pakistan.
Rejecting the idea of judicial martial law, he said that it is a hypothetical idea and unless he is there at his position, no one could bypass the constitution.

“There is no room for martial law in the country. If I am unable to stop it I will go home. I will not endorse it” the chief justice said will addressing an event at the Supreme Court Bar Association.
The chief justice also spoke about reports of a judicial martial law. “Why would we be putting our self into any judicial martial law or judicial takeover? This rumour is being spread by a design or plan.”
“If I will not be able to halt such step from anyone then I pack up and go home,” he said adding that those spreading the idea of judicial martial law are spreading confusion among minds.
He said that such propaganda is being made through a design or plan. “There will be democracy and supremacy of constitution in the country, “he vowed.
The chief justice added that the time had passed where they would tolerate such shame, adding that there would only be democracy in the country and they would not allow the constitution to be violated.
“It is my promise to the nation that if we are unable to do this than I don’t deserve to be the chief justice, I’ll be leaving the job.”
The country’s top judge also assured that there was no margin in the constitution to allow for a delay in the general elections. “Thankfully we have a Constitution that states everything,” he asserted.
“If you think elections cannot be postponed because there is no margin to do so in the Constitution then they would not be delayed, but if you think there are chances then this could happen.”
However, the chief justice added that parts of the Constitution that he has read do not allow elections to be postponed.
“Apart from the Constitution, there is faith that the public of Pakistan has entrusted upon me, which I will not breach,” Chief Justice Nisar said while talking about elections being conducted on time.
The CJP said he did not deem it right to speak much on these topics as the event he was addressing was held in honour of the services of human rights activist and noted lawyer Asma Jahangir, who passed away earlier this year.
Speaking about Asma Jahangir, the CJP said she had great leadership qualities and above all was a great humanitarian.
Recalling the days when they worked together, Chief Justice Nisar said Jahangir would volunteer to take up cases of women who could not afford lawyers, before he would assign them to anyone.
“She always had the courage and passion to work for the poor and down-trodden people of the society,” the CJP said. “Don’t have much words to express her personality.”

He said he will urge Sattar to challenge the verdict because the ECP is a “repository of information and not a trial court”.The ECP which cannot hold a trial does not have the jurisdiction to pass such judgments, he claimed. He observed that the verdict was not read out by the ECP bench, but was disclosed by a reader.

“The public is being pushed into poverty as the corrupt leaders get richer,” Imran exclaimed.
He further said that corrupt practices of the country’s leaders have destroyed public institutions. The PTI chief, in his address, promised to strengthen the country’s institutions by eliminating corruption, if his party is elected in the general elections.
“The nation will transform when the same money that is looted from the public will be spent on them,” Imran said, adding that the most important part of his party’s agenda was to empower the hardworking people of the country.Discussing the law enforcement authorities and security conditions across Pakistan, Imran alleged that the police force in Sindh and Punjab had been politicised.

The division caused Karachi a lot of damage, he said, adding that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had the highest rate of terrorism, but today it is peaceful.
Earlier in the day, the  PTI chairman Imran Khan arrived in Karachi for a two-day visit. Upon his arrival at the airport, he briefly addressed a small gathering of employees of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) who came to welcome him.The PTI chief said the current government has only three months of its tenure left, and it “does not have the mandate to privatise PIA.” The Sharifs’ steel mills churn out millions whereas the Pakistan Steel Mill is lying here closed, Khan lamented.
There is no need for privatisation if the institutions function with honesty, he added. Later in the day, Khan attended a doctors’ forum where he stressed on the need to combat poverty in the country.
“Today we are lagging behind in human development [compared to the rest of the subcontinent], because no government took responsibility for lifting the people out of poverty,” the PTI chairman said.
He said that the government’s efforts should focus on breaking the vicious cycle of poverty. “In Pakistan, only policies are made. There is no real thought on how to reduce poverty.” Drawing attention to Lahore, Khan declared it the “world’s most polluted” city, adding that 70% of the city’s population does not have access to safe drinking water.
Taking aim at the Punjab Chief Minister, Khan said that Shehbaz Sharif has had “billions” of rupees’ worth of budget, yet he did not build a single new hospital in the region.

On Feb 21, the apex court had issued the order on several petitions challenging the law.
Written by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, the 51-page judgment comes days after Nawaz Sharif passed the mantle of his party on his younger brother Shahbaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Punjab.
“To hold that a person who is disqualified to be king can nevertheless be given a freehand to operate as a kingmaker, who may despite lacking qualification and without going through the electoral process, act as a puppet master pull the strings and exercise political power vicariously would amount to making a complete mockery of the Constitution, the legislative process, the law, the government and values that we hold so dear and have consciously worked for, defended and incorporated in the Constitution,” the judgment stated further.The judgement also discusses allegations against Sharif that stemmed from Panama Papers revelations about offshore companies of the then ruling family and that became basis for his disqualification as prime minister.
The judgment has said further that if sections 203 and 232 of the law are read independently of the Constitution, it would be like opening the doors to control of political parties through remote control.
Moreover, the court has ruled that the law would have allowed those people to control the legislature who are otherwise unfit to be in Parliament as per the Constitution.

The court has also ruled that the Panama Papers case revealed names of Nawaz’s children as owners of offshore companies, adding that the then-prime minister failed to satisfy the public due to his contradictory statements.
It added that Nawaz was disqualified as prime minister on the basis of the joint investigation team’s report under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court on February declared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif ineligible to continue as president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for being a disqualified person declared by a court of law and declared null and void all actions taken by the former prime minister in capacity of party leader.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid, MNA Jamshaid Dasti, National Party and the Pakistan Peoples Party, among others, had challenged the law for allowing a disqualified parliamentarian to become a party head.
The petitions, challenging specific clauses of the Elections Act 2017, stated that Nawaz’s appointment as party president was in violation of Clause 5 of the Political Parties Order 2002 and Article 17 of the Constitution.
The apex court also ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan to denotify Nawaz Sharif as president of the PML-N.
In a swift compliance of the judgement, the ECP removed the name of Nawaz Sharif as the head of the ruling PML-N from the list of registered political parties.The Election Commission also directed the PML-N’s acting secretary general Ahsan Iqbal to elect an acting president within seven days and conduct party elections within 45 days to elect president of the party.
A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umer Ata Bandyal and Justice Ijazul Ahsen, announced the short order.

A two-member full bench conducted hearing on Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Nawabzada Nawazish Ali‘s plea during which, the petitioner said that Dar is a proclaimed accused in Panama Leaks case due to which he cannot participate in the elections.
The claimant requested the court to annul the verdict of allowing former minister to contest Senate polls.
Subsequently, the court dismissed the plea and upheld its decision.The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had nominated Ishaq Dar as its Senate candidate for another three-year term as nine of the PML-N Senators are due to retire next month after completing their terms.
The papers were rejected by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which was in LHC’s appellate tribunal. He had adopted stance that the returning officer rejected the nomination papers contrary to the facts.
The court after hearing the arguments of both the parties permitted Dar to take part in Senate elections. Moreover, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s sister Sadia Abbasi and Nuzhat Sadiq were also allowed to contest the Senate polls.In December 2017, the anti-corruption court had declared Dar, currently seeking medical treatment in London, an “absconder” after he repeatedly failed to appear before it in a graft case linking to the Panama Papers scandal.
He was indicted in October last year in a graft case in which he is accused of making assets that were “disproportionate to his known sources of income”.
The case was filed against him by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the light of the Supreme Court order of July 28 that disqualified Nawaz Sharif as prime minister in the Panama Papers scandal.In its case against Dar, the NAB has alleged that the accused has acquired assets and pecuniary interests/resources in his own name and/or in the name of his dependants of an approximate amount of Rs 831.678 million.
Dar is in London since October and has been seeking treatment of an undefined heart complication at a Harley Street hospital.

Meanwhile, Election Commission of Pakistan has removed Nawaz Sharif’s Name from party leadership after supreme court’s verdict.
ECP removed Nawaz’s name as the party president from its record and said the position now stands vacant.According to the ECP, the name was removed under orders from the Supreme Court.
The electoral body added that Nawaz’s name shall be deemed to have been removed as party president from its election record from July 28, 2017.
ECP received Supreme Court’s decision related to disqualification of Nawaz Sharif as Party head, it has removed Nawaz name as President PML N.The space for party head’s name is now left empty after the verdict from the supreme court.
Earlier, Supreme Court (SC) of Pakistan disqualified Nawaz Sharif as president of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the verdict regarding petitions against Election Act of 2017.

The apex court elaborated that a person disqualified under Article 62, 63 of the Constitution can not head the party. Furthermore, as a result of the verdict, all decisions taken by Nawaz as PML-N’s president stand null and void.
While announcing the verdict, the apex court said that a person who doesn’t qualify on Article 62 and 63 of the constitution can also not hold the office of presidency of any political party.
“Ineligible person cannot hold the office of party presidency,” the court said. SC has also annulled all decisions made by Nawaz Sharif as the party head.It added that the tickets for Senate elections issued by him will now be cancelled. The ruling party will now have to re-announce its candidates for the Senate polls that were scheduled for next month.
After hearing the petitions against Election Act of 2017, Supreme Court had reserved its verdict to decide the political fate of Nawaz Sharif.
Earlier today, the Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Mian Saqib Nisar concluded on Thursday the hearing of several petitions against the recently-passed Elections Act 2017.
A three-member bench had been hearing several petitions challenging specific clauses of the act that led to Nawaz Sharif’s appointment as party president following his dismissal as prime minister last year.During today’s hearing, the chief justice remarked that the country’s leadership is respectable, adding that the media misreported the court’s remarks.
Chief Justice Nisar also observed that there is no reason for the apex court to use words like thief, adding that the fallout of the issue is unacceptable.
Addressing the Pakistan Peoples Party counsel Latif Khosa during the hearing, the chief justice remarked that there would be a difference in rallies held by you or [slain party leader and former prime minister] Benazir Bhutto.
Another petitioner’s counsel, Farogh Naseem, argued that there is a precedent of a court order against a political party’s head.The chief justice remarked that in other countries intra-party elections are held but the situation is different in Pakistan.
“The party head is an important position,” the chief justice observed, adding that in Pakistan people are willing to sacrifice their lives for their leaders.
Following Nawaz’s disqualification as prime minister in July 2017 in the Panama Papers case, the ruling party managed to amend the Constitution to allow the former premier to retain his chairmanship of the PML-N.As a result, the Elections Act 2017 was passed by Parliament bringing Nawaz back as the party president despite his disqualification from the National Assembly.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid, MNA Jamshaid Dasti, National Party and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), among others, challenged the law for allowing a disqualified parliamentarian to become a party head.
The petitions, challenging specific clauses of the Elections Act 2017, state that Nawaz’s appointment as party president is in violation of Clause 5 of the Political Parties Order 2002 and Article 17 of the Constitution.In January 2018, SC had accepted petitions the petitions for hearing against the Election Act of 2017. These petitions were submitted by Awami Muslim League (AML), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and other political parties as well as groups of lawyers.
“The bill was passed in the NA by the vote of all parties and can only be annulled if is contradictory to basic rights,” CJP had remarked in one of the hearing.
CJP led the three-member bench to hear the petitions.The approval of Electoral Reforms Bill 2017 had paved way for sacked premier Nawaz Sharif to become president of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). It was passed from both houses of parliament despite the bone of contention being its Section 203 which allowed the ex-PM to hold office as PML-N president.
Top court disqualified Nawaz from premiership
In July 2017, the top court had disqualified Nawaz Sharif from premiership in connection with Panama Papers case under Article 62. The five-judge larger bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa and comprising Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan, Justice Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed and Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan unanimously announced the decision in courtroom No 1.
PM Nawaz is no more truthful and honest as he failed to prove his assets of 2013, Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan told the packed courtroom.

The dismantling of ruling party PML-N government in Balochistan and rift among the MQM-P leaders, that clearly divided the party in tow groups, have paved the way of horse trading in upcoming senate polls that will be held on March 3.From the prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to other politicians every one talking about the horse trading that has rung the bell of aggravation of the situation. The politicians either side of the parliament- Ruling or Opposition benches- are blaming to each other for horse trading.The Balochistan is more on crosshairs of horse trading after the toppling of PML-N majority government that can lead defeat of PML-N in Balochistan and likely horse trading will work here.
The other likely epicenter of horse trading is Federally Administrative Tribal Areas (FATA) where only 11 senators will elect four senators, it means a aspirant needs only support of four senators to become the member of upper house. It means, if only six out of 11 decided the priority list of aspirants they can become successful to elect their favourit candidates.Amid the echoes of horse trading former chairman senate Waseem Sajjad has given suggestion that if someone wanted to stop horse trading in senate polls the direct election should be the possible way to get rid of this menace.
Some analysts have the view that secret balloting is another tool to help boost the horse trading. In this process a member parliament, particularly MPAs, is compelled to vote for his party aspirant in his first priority, however he can vote on second priority list to the candidate who is nearest to his heart or pocket.Another major fault of present procedure of electing senate member is how to find out the voter who is indulged in horse trading. On the other hand leader of the opposition Aitzaz Ahsan  opposed the direct election for senate and urged some other ways to handle the issue.

The appeal had demanded the court to annul the action of returning officer.
The opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had challenged the nomination papers of Dar, pointing out that Dar was declared absconder in the corruption reference against him heard by NAB court.ECP ruled that Dar is ineligible to contest in the Senate elections since there is a pending corruption case against him in the accountability court.
The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had nominated Ishaq Dar as its Senate candidate for another three-year term as nine of the PML-N Senators are due to retire next month after completing their terms.Dar was to contest in the Senate polls over two seats, a general seat and technocrat seat. The PTI lawyer reasoned that Dar submitted the same account details for expenditure while contesting for both seats.
At least 52 Senators will retire next month ahead of the Senate elections on March 3. PML-N is likely to gain an overwhelming majority in the upper house of parliament.

564,13 Russians Indicted for Meddling In US Elections,https://abbtakk.tv/en/13-russians-indicted-for-meddling-in-us-elections/,"February 17, 2018","Washington (February 17, 2018): Special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 presidential election, charging them with conspiracy to defraud the United States, the Department of Justice announced Friday.
In addition, three defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft.“The defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the United States, with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said.
Mueller had convened the grand jury as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as any possible connections between Russia and Trump campaign associates.FBI Director Chris Wray and Rosenstein briefed President Donald Trump on the indictments at the White House on Friday morning, a White House official said.
Beginning as early as 2014, the Russian organization Internet Research Agency began operations to interfere with the US political system, including the 2016 elections, according to the indictment.
The defendants allegedly posed as US persons, created false US personas and operated social media pages and groups designed to attract US audiences, the indictment reads.
The Internet Research Agency had a “strategic goal to sow discord in the US political system” including the election, according to the indictment.Russians posted “derogatory information about a number of candidates,” and by mid-2016 they supported Trump and disparaged Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. They bought ads and communicated with “unwitting” people tied to Trump campaign and others to coordinate political activities.
Rosenstein said Friday that the indictment does not contain any allegations that any Americans knowingly participated in the activity.
“There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,” he said. “There is no allegation in the indictment that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.”
Rosenstein added that the special counsel’s investigation is ongoing.

574,All You Need To Know About Maldives’ Political Crisis,https://abbtakk.tv/en/400598-2all-you-need-to-know-about-maldives-ongoing-political-crisis/,"February 11, 2018","Web Desk (February 11, 2018): The Maldives is engulfed in a deepening political crisis, as the introduction of a state of emergency decree across the holiday islands prompted heavily-armed troops to storm the country’s top court and arrest a former president.
What happened?
In an unexpected move last week, the Maldives Supreme Court ordered the release of several imprisoned opposition lawmakers, ruling that their trials were politically motivated.President Abdulla Yameen refused to comply with the decision and instead imposed a state of emergency for a period of 15 days. This afforded him sweeping powers to send security forces into the Supreme Court building in the capital city of Male on Monday
Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Judge Ali Hameed were both arrested in the early hours of Tuesday, local police said via Twitter, although charges were not specified. Their detention was soon followed by the arrest of Yameen’s estranged half-brother, former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom — who had ruled the country for more than 30 years until a transition to democracy in 2008.What’s the background?
Gayoom, who has sided with the opposition party since leaving office a decade ago, has been a vocal critic of the current president. He was succeeded by Mohamed Nasheed in 2009, who served during a brief period of multiparty democracy before being controversially ousted five years after taking office.
Nasheed was internationally recognized for his efforts in addressing the impact of climate change on the Maldives. However, he was imprisoned in 2015 on terrorism charges — which his supporters say were contrived.
Security forces stand outside Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) office as they barricade it,in the capital of the Maldives, Male on February 7, 2018. The Maldives president on February 7 welcomed a Supreme Court move to reinstate the convictions of high-profile political prisoners after he arrested two top judges and declared a state of emergency, plunging the upmarket holiday paradise into chaos.
After being allowed to leave prison a year later on medical grounds, Nasheed was granted asylum in Britain. He was reportedly expected to challenge Yameen in presidential elections later this year, before the current political dispute triggered the ensuing crisis.
Yameen has been in power since 2013, following a disputed election that his opponents claim was rigged. Since then, he has been accused of jailing critics, cracking down on dissent and ultimately eroding the country’s democratic process.How has the world reacted?
Both former leaders of the Maldives, Nasheed and Gayoom, have called on India to force Yameen to release the recently jailed high court judges and political prisoners. While intervention from New Delhi would certainly be unusual, it is not unprecedented. India sent troops to the Maldives in 1988 to foil a coup.
Alongside India, the U.S. and the U.K. have both urged Yameen to honor the rule of law and free the detainees.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement: “President Yameen has systematically alienated his coalition, jailed or exiled every major opposition political figure, deprived elected members of parliament of their right to represent their voters in the legislature, revised laws to erode human rights… and weakened the institutions of government.”Meanwhile, the United Nations (UN) human rights chief warned Wednesday that Yameen’s state of emergency decree, which had been used to imprison perceived political opponents, was undermining the checks and balances necessary in any functioning democracy.
“The suspension of several functions of the judiciary and parliament, and the restrictions on a series of constitutional rights, create a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of the president,” Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said in a statement.Is it safe to travel?
The Maldives is a hugely popular tourist destination, especially among Chinese and British visitors, and the latest turmoil comes amid peak tourism season for the tropical islands.
Nearly 1.4 million tourists worldwide traveled to the Indian Ocean islands in 2017, according to government statistics. In 2016, Reuters reported that the Maldives earned $2.7 billion from holidaymakers visiting luxury hotels and scuba-diving resorts.
On Tuesday, the Maldives Ministry of Foreign Affairs attempted to reassure vacationers that the situation remained calm and would not affect tourism.
However, in the wake of the latest political crisis, the U.S., China, India and the U.K. have all issued advisories against traveling to the Maldives.

A system cannot run if a leader is not allowed to handle the party affairs, Dr Sattar added.He asserted that the commission would write to him to nominate candidates for Senate elections that are scheduled for March. He reiterated that he is the constitutional and nominated head of the political party.
MQMP chief said that party’s differences should not be discussed in the media and his political experience wisdom should be trusted on.

A three-member Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Saqib Nisar resumed hearing today several petitions challenging the Elections Act 2017.
The Supreme Court has taken up around half a dozen petitions against disqualified prime minister Nawaz Sharif being reelected party president after the passage of the Elections Act.
As proceedings commenced today, Nawaz submitted a request through his counsel stating that he would not become part of the proceedings.Moreover, PML-N Chairman Raja Zafarul Haq appeared in court today on behalf of his party and was represented by counsel Salman Akram Raja.
The chief justice observed that it is Nawaz’s prerogative not to become part of the case, adding that the case will continue without his input.
Barrister Farogh Naseem, representing opposition MNA Sheikh Rashid, told the court that the law was brought only 17 days after Sharif’s disqualification by the Supreme Court in Panamagate case.
The court asked Naseem to explain how the act was in contradiction with the Constitution.
The counsel replied that according to Article 63-A of the Constitution, important powers were vested in the office of party chief, including disqualification of a legislator belonging to their party. The party chief can also influence legislation and election of prime minister, Naseem argued.He said that the act would allow someone declared untruthful and untrustworthy by the courts to influence parliamentary business.
“According to you, party chief has a lot of powers,” Justice Nisar remarked. Justice Ijazul Ahsan said that according to the counsel, the party chief would be a kingmaker of sorts and an untrustworthy and untruthful person will control Sadiq (truthful) and Ameen (trustworthy) legislators.
Naseem argued that it is the people’s fundamental right to be represented by honest people.
He said that Nawaz Sharif was unable to provide a money trail in Panama Papers case but was cut short by the CJP who said that the matter has been decided and should not be discussed further.Meanwhile, ousted premier Nawaz Sharif’s counsel Azam Nazeer Tarar has prepared a written answer regarding his client’s disqualification under Article 62(1)(f).
Azam Nazeer Tarar has opted the stance that disqualification period has not been determined, therefore, it is not for lifetime. He maintained that barring anyone from participating in elections would be against the basic rights.
The lawyer stated that ineligibility under Article 62(1)(f) is for one time only as disqualification for life is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution.
Azam Nazeer Tarar maintained that ineligibility in contempt of court charges is of five years, and disqualification term in other cases has also been determined but not in Article 62(1)(f).The counsel further added that he will submit his reply in the apex court after consulting with Nawaz Sharif.
Earlier, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif informed the Supreme Court on Tuesday that he will not become part of the proceedings challenging his re-election as party chief following the passing of the Elections Act 2017.
At the last hearing of the case on January 23, senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Khawaja Saad Rafique appeared before the court.
During the hearing, the chief justice remarked that Rafique gives very passionate speeches and should speak for himself in court.The chief justice also instructed that after the hearing, there will no media talk outside the court.
Following Nawaz’s disqualification as prime minister in July 2017 in the Panama Papers case, the ruling party managed to amend the Constitution to allow the former premier to retain his chairmanship of the PML-N.
As a result, the Elections Act 2017 was passed by Parliament bringing Nawaz back as the party president despite his disqualification from the National Assembly.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid, MNA Jamshaid Dasti, National Party and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), among others, challenged the law for allowing a disqualified parliamentarian to become a party head.
The petitions, challenging specific clauses of the recently passed Elections Act 2017, state that Nawaz’s appointment as party president is in violation of Clause 5 of the Political Parties Order 2002 and Article 17 of the Constitution.

Nawaz began his speech by thanking his hosts and the people present at the venue. “I’ve asked Maryam to address you [participants],” he informed.
The three-time premier said he has never seen a bigger rally than this in the history of Kashmir.Nawaz said today’s rally is three times bigger than the one he addressed at the same venue after winning the 2013 elections.
“No [court] decision can break the bond I have with people of Kashmir,” Nawaz asserted, referring to his disqualification as prime minister by the Supreme Court last year. “My heart beats equally for Pakistanis and Kashmiris,” he said later.
Addressing Kashmiris across the border in Indian held territory, Nawaz condemned the state brutality and said the “people of Pakistan stand with you”.

He also paid tribute to the separatists in India-held Kashmir and lauded their “bravery”. He vowed to stand by the people of Kashmir that were struggling for their right to self-determination.“The brave people of Kashmir are being blinded by the pellet guns used to fire at them,” Nawaz said, referring to incidents of injuries resulting from Indian forces’ use of pellet guns against separatists in Kashmir. “Don’t lose heart! God is with you.”

Former president Asif Ali Zardari has directed the party leadership in Punjab to make arrangements for the public meeting at historical Mochi gate area of Lahore on February 5 for expressing solidarity with the victims of Indian atrocities in held Kashmir and ceasefire violation in AJK.The decision to hold the public meeting was taken after a meeting between Punjab leadership of the party and co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari. The party would also use the event to express solidarity with the Kashmiris.Sources said that Asif Ali Zardari will give India a strong message on the occasion to stop violations of the Line of Control (LoC) and that the pledge to continue moral, political and diplomatic support of the Kashmiris would be renewed. The rally would be addressed by central leaders of the party.
Earlier, PPP blamed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led Punjab government for removing its banners put up in various parts of the city for its forthcoming public gathering.PPP Punjab spokesperson Sajjad Anwar  had said the ruling party is scared of the PPP power show and is using such tactics to create obstructions in its way.
“The PML-N will get nothing from such tactics and the ‘Takht-e-Lahore’ will see the power of the public on February 5,” he said.PPP Punjab President Qamar Zaman Kaira said the PPP will hold an enormous rally on February 5. The Sharif brothers should know that they will not be winning the general elections of 2018, instead will be in the Adiala jail before the elections, he said.
“Nowhere in the world are such negative tactics used in a democratic setup, but the Sharif brothers are using these because they think that the whole country is their personal fiefdom,” Kaira said.
“It is a matter of shame for the ruling party that the banners and other hangings are being torn apart in various parts of the city,” he added.He said that unfortunately the Sharif brothers have learnt nothing from the past and are resorting to such poor tactics to malign the opposition. The former prime minister visited Karachi for a public gathering and the PPP-led Sindh government created no hurdles to affect his political activities, he said.
The Lahore administration at the behest of the Punjab government and Sharif brothers issued a conditional no-objection certificate (NOC) to the PPP for holding the public rally. The administration has imposed weird restrictions on the PPP including one that bars it from criticising state institutions like the army and the judiciary, said Kaira.
Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday reached Lahore and is personally monitoring the arrangements for the public gathering.

592,Russia Alleges US Of Meddling In Its Elections,https://abbtakk.tv/en/russia-alleges-us-of-meddling-in-its-elections/,"January 30, 2018","Moscow (January 30, 2018): Russia said a United States Treasury report that could extend sanctions against Moscow for meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections is “a direct and obvious attempt” to interfere in its own upcoming presidential vote.
By the end of Monday, the Treasury must send Congress a list of rich Russian business figures and detail their ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
US President Donald Trump reluctantly signed the legislation last August that ordered the report, even though US investigators believe he was the main beneficiary of Russian meddling.“We do think that this is a direct and obvious attempt to time some sort of action to coincide with our elections in order to influence them,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on a telephone conference call Monday. “We disagree with this, and we are sure this will have no influence.”
He said publication of the report “will be analyzed in Moscow, so that our interests and the interests of our companies are guaranteed.”Russia is to hold presidential elections on March 18, a contest that seems certain to result in a win for Russian President Vladimir Putin because of tight constraints against political opponents.
Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was briefly arrested Sunday during anti-Kremlin demonstrations in Moscow and across Russia and will have to attend a court hearing he wrote on Twitter.Peskov said he did not think Navalny was a threat to Putin’s power. “Putin’s popularity reaches far beyond Russian borders and I don’t think anyone can doubt the fact that Putin is an absolute leader in the way he is perceived by the public and an absolute leader of the political Olympus,” he said.
“It’s unlikely that at this stage there is someone who is serious competition. Putin proved his undeniable leadership on multiple occasions and continues to do that,” Peskov added.

Talking to media after the inauguration of NADRA’s mobile registration vans, he said that the recent changes in policies regarding visas and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) will benefit Pakistan.
“We are not only in agreement over security requirement, but are also following them,” Iqbal said while speaking in Islamabad about the recent changes to the on-arrival visa policy for the country.Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority had announced that groups of tourists from a number of “tourism-friendly” countries are now being allowed on-arrival visas.
According to a notification posted on the official Twitter account of the aviation authority, the visa-on-arrival option will be available to group tourists from 24 countries “if the tour is organised through designated tour operators in Pakistan”.
“On one hand we need to complete our security requirements and on the other facilitate legitimate traffic of tourists, investors and businessmen,” he said.He said that Pakistan has a lot to gain from people of developed countries arriving in Pakistan but that the developed countries have nothing to lose by their people not arriving to the country.
On a question on why he was changing all policies enacted by his predecessor Chaudhry Nisar, he said: “We are not changing our policies, only rationalising them.”
Nisar and Iqbal had recently been in an agreement in the national assembly over changes made to the government’s policy.Nisar had said he had revoked the visa-on-arrival policy because it had been massively misused in the past, especially during the Musharraf regime.
Amidst desk-thumping by some of the opposition members, he had issued the directives that visa on arrival should be a bilateral affair. He was of the view that if a Pakistani parliamentarian was required to visit the embassy of a country for a visa then MPs of that country should also be required to visit Pakistan’s embassy.
“It is easy to say that Japan, United States or Britain’s minister [wanting to come to Pakistan] will also have to come to our embassy if our ministers have to go to their embassy,” Iqbal said today.

Reiterating his demanded of FATA merger with KP Imran warned Fazalur Rehman was playing a dangerous game on the issue as he feared if FATA merges with KP the entire credit will go to PTI.
Replying to a query he warned that old system has been wrapped up in FATA that has created a space and if it lasted more time it can be led to terrorism again in the tribal areas.
“Delay in merger of FATA and KP is the cruelty done with the people of the areas and Pakistan as only given access to court of tribal people is not enough and its entire system immediately should be emerged with KP,” he said.
He confirmed that he has received resignations of the party members.
He said that the final decision regarding the resignations will be taken after consultations with senior PTI leaders.Earlier today, a session of the PTI’s central executive committee (CEC) was held. Sources had informed that the party members had given the authority to decide on resignations from assemblies to Imran Khan.
The session had concluded that Imran’s decision on resignations of party members from the assemblies would be final.
During the meeting, committee members also proposed suggestions for nominations on party tickets for the upcoming general elections.
The CEC approved, during the session, the process for concluding the party’s membership drive and passed motions of solidarity with Palestine and Kashmir.Two factions in the party seemed to have emerged — one in favour of resignations from the assembly, and the other strongly opposed to it.
The group opposed to resignations from assemblies and dissolving the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa legislature reasons that PTI would not be able to claim its share in the caretaker government if it takes the extreme measure, sources said.
Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah earlier said on Monday that after Imran’s statements denouncing the parliament, the resignations of the party’s lawmakers should have come immediately.
On Monday, the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution condemning Imran Khan and Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rasheed’s remarks against the parliament.The resolution stated that Imran insulted the parliament by hurling abuses at it, adding that Imran should apologise to the nation.

“I give laanat (curse) the parliament that made a criminal the president of a party,” he said, in an apparent reference to ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif being elected the PML-N president.
Imran’s remarks followed the repeated cursing of the Parliament from Rasheed, who also announced his resignation from the assembly.

602,Trump Renews NSA’s Internet Surveillance Programme,https://abbtakk.tv/en/trump-renews-nsas-internet-surveillance-programme/,"January 20, 2018","Washington (January 20, 2018): United States President Donald Trump on Friday said signed into law a bill renewing the National Security Agency’s (NSA) warrant less internet surveillance program, sealing a defeat for digital privacy advocates.
“Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to legislation passed by the US Congress that extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 19, 2018
The law renews for six years and with minimal changes the NSA programme, which gathers information from foreigners overseas but incidentally collects an unknown amount of communications belonging to Americans.The measure easily passed the US House of Representatives last week despite mixed signals posted on Twitter by Trump and narrowly avoided a filibuster in the Senate earlier this week that split party lines. The measure had drawn opposition from a coalition of privacy-minded Democrats and libertarian Republicans.
In his tweet on Friday, Trump attempted to clarify why he signed the bill despite repeating an unsubstantiated claim that his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on Trump’s 2016 Republican presidential campaign.“This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election,” Trump wrote. “I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!”Without Trump’s signature, Section 702 had been set to expire on Friday, though intelligence officials had said the surveillance programme could continue to operate until April.
Under the law, the NSA is allowed to eavesdrop on vast amounts of digital communications from foreigners living outside the United States via US companies like Facebook Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

The decision was made during a high-level meeting between the representatives of the three parties at Jati Umra. The meeting participants remarked that they will not accept the decisions made by a few people over the decision of the people.
The meeting was attended by PM Azad Kashmir Raja Farooq Haider, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Nawaz’s daughter Maryam Nawaz, and Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Abdul Qadir Baloch, Minister for Maritime Affairs Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, among others.The meeting discussed in detail the no-confidence movement against the former Balochistan CM Nawab Sanaullah Zehri last week.
Zehri was forced to resign following a no-confidence motion against him which was supported by some PML-N members. Following the movement, Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, hails from the PML-Quaid, was elected as the new chief minister.
The participants remarked that Balochistan is the province where political stability was needed the most. Once the stability was achieved through a reconciliation process, political turmoil was brought in overnight.During the meeting, the MPAs from Balochistan shared that the movement was held without bringing it into the notice of the parliamentarians. Those involved in the movement never mentioned that they were unhappy under the leadership of the former CM, pointed out meeting participants.
The need for organising this movement mere four to five months before the general elections was also questioned. The participants also inquired when, where and how the decision to elect a new CM made.
Some members claimed that electing a person who secured a few 100 votes goes against the spirit of democracy.Meeting participants said that such actions went against the democratic rights of the people of Balochistan, adding that this is an insult to the rights given to the people in the Constitution.
Earlier in the day, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif presided over a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) meeting at Jati Umra.
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had arrived in Lahore to attend the meeting.

Responding to a question during a press briefing on Saturday, Khan said he has been a strong opponent of Pakistan’s participation in the war on terror following the 9/11 attacks on the US. “Pakistan had nothing to do with it,” he said
He remarked that though he supported co-operation with the United States but not the involvement of Pakistan’s military into a ground battle with its own people in the tribal regions.
Khan said that Trump scapegoated Pakistan for the US-led coalition’s failure to defeat the Taliban and bring peace to Afghanistan, and that “it was very insulting of him.”The PTI leader added that the US dishonours the memory of thousands of Pakistan’s soldiers who died battling insurgents in its tribal regions, as well as that of tens of thousands of Pakistanis who died in terrorist attacks.
“The way the United States has treated Pakistan as a doormat is not fair,” he said.
Khan said he was committed to mainstreaming tens of thousands of madrassas in the country.
He said he wants graduates of religious seminaries to have skills that will allow them to find jobs across all sectors. “As it stands, madrassa graduates are ill-equipped to work as anything other than clerics or prayer leaders,” he added.
“We will train their teachers to bring them into the mainstream,” he said, without providing details on how that would be accomplished.

The petition, filed by Advocate Raees Abdul Wahid, challenged the Election Act, 2017, which paved the way for the disqualified prime minister to once again be appointed leader of his party after being removed from the past following the Panamagate verdict.
During the hearing, Wahid urged the court to nullify Articles 203 and 232 that enable a disqualified person to assume charge of a political party, saying that legislation should be passed for the benefit of the nation, not an individual.
The hearing was adjourned until Jan 20.The Parliament in October had passed the Elections Act 2017 despite strong protest from opposition parties. The law features a controversial amendment that will allow politicians disqualified from holding public office to head a political party.
This is not the first time that the Act has been challenged in court. Most of the petitioners are political opponents of Nawaz, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid, Jamshed Dasti etc.

617,Protests in Iran: President Rouhani Calls For Unity,https://abbtakk.tv/en/protests-in-iran-president-rouhani-calls-for-unity/,"January 2, 2018","Tehran (January 2, 2018): Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tried to downplay the significance of sometimes violent protests across his country that have left 12 people dead in the biggest challenge to the authority of the Tehran regime since mass demonstrations in 2009.
“Our great nation has witnessed a number of similar incidents in the past and has comfortably dealt with them. This is nothing,” Rouhani said in a meeting with Iranian members of parliament on Monday.Rouhani has called for calm as his government tries to deal with the widespread spontaneous uprising.
State media reported Monday that a man “creating a disturbance” shot at police with a “hunting gun,” killing one officer and wounding three others. The shooting happened in Najafabab, a provincial town in the center of Iran.Rouhani called out Donald Trump on Monday after a series of tweets from the US President in support of the protests. US Vice President Mike Pence tweeted support for protesters Monday, saying “We will not let them down.”Rouhani has acknowledged that Iranians have the right to protest legally but urged national unity Monday as “the first and most important step at this stage.”
A significant Internet outage was reported across Iran on Monday afternoon, but some users said it was working again. Iran’s Ministry of Information said agitators in the disturbances have been identified and arrested, and warned that people participating in illegal activities would be “seriously dealt with.”
The protests were sparked by concerns about rising living costs and a stagnant economy, but developed into a broader outcry against the regime.
They are the most serious challenge to Tehran’s authority since the so-called Green Movement of 2009, when millions marched in the capital to protest the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The opposition alleged the vote was rigged.

618,2017 Year In Review: Here Are The Top 10 Biggest News Stories,https://abbtakk.tv/en/2017-year-in-review-here-are-the-top-10-biggest-news-stories/,"January 1, 2018","Web Desk (january 1, 2018): As the New Year approaches, it seems like every year is dubbed “a year like no other.” But 2017 truly was more dramatic than many other years in recent memory.
In the last 12 months, we faced a renewed threat of nuclear war, debated whether to take a knee during the national anthem and resisted the temptation to look at the sun during the total solar eclipse.
From increased tensions with North Korea, to a hurricane season unlike any other, to the bombshell allegations of sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond, take a look back at the key moments of 2017.
1.Donald Trump: Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20, outlining his vision of a new national populism and reiterating the same “America First” mantra that delivered the White House to him during the 2016 election.
In his first address as leader of the free world, Trump said his inauguration would signify a historic moment when “the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”
After months on the campaign trail marked by partisan division and deep skepticism from his critics, Trump told thousands in the nation’s capital that his agenda was for every American — even as protesters demonstrated against him elsewhere in Washington, D.C., including some who clashed with police hours later.
The next day, half a million marchers demonstrated for gender equality and against the new president during the Women’s March on Washington, brandishing pink hats and homemade signs in the streets near the National Mall.
Now more than a year since his election, Trump is enjoying a healthy economy marked by lower unemployment numbers and strong stock market performance.
But he has struggled to fulfill his many campaign promises with major legislation. Since his inauguration, the push to repeal and replace Obamacare has failed three times, and his plans to build a border wall and invest billions in infrastructure have been put on hold.
2.The Mueller Investigation: Bowing to public and congressional pressure, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller in May as a special counsel to conduct the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.
More than five months later, Mueller’s office indicted President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his longtime business associate Rick Gates on 12 charges, including money laundering, being an unregistered foreign agent and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.
The special counsel’s office also announced that day that it had struck a cooperation agreement with former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, who secretly pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents about his contacts with Kremlin-connected Russians.
In early December, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty in federal court to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, and agreed to cooperate with Mueller’s probe.
The special counsel’s investigation is still ongoing.
3.Greater Tensions with North Korea:American tensions with North Korea intensified rapidly since President Donald Trump was inaugurated in late January, as leader Kim Jong Un made no secret that his scientists are working on a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S.
Kim Im Ryong, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, bluntly warned that the Trump administration’s tough talk was creating “a dangerous situation in which thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.”
The situation has become so dire that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked China — Pyongyang’s neighbor and most powerful ally — to “use their influence to convince or compel North Korea to rethink its strategic calculus.”
Tensions escalated in June when Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American student, died days after being released from a North Korean prison in an unconscious state.
The regime’s actions has led Trump and his administration to ratchet up the rhetoric, with the president in August promising “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if North Korea continues to threaten the U.S. Trump also disparaged the North Korean leader as a “rocket man” during his first address to the United Nations.
4. The MeToo MovementIn early October, back-to-back bombshell drops in New Y New Yorker revealed that film mogul Harvey Weinstein allegedly lured women into hotel rooms and bars, and sexually harassed or assaulted them in what some have described as an open secret known for years in Hollywood Later that month, after a tweet from actress Alyssa Milano, who was one of Weinstein’s accusers, social media was inundated with personal stories of being the victims of sexual harassment or assault, all using the hashtag #MeToo.
Weinstein’s downfall has seemingly emboldened others to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent men. In recent months alone, at least 30 powerful men in entertainment, business, politics and the news media have been publicly condemned for their alleged sexual misconduct and many have lost their jobs as a result, including Weinstein.
“The Silence Breakers” of the #MeToo movement, who gave a voice to sexual assault and harassment survivors, have since been named Time magazine’s 2017 Person of the Year.
5.The Massacres in Las Vegas and Texas:On Oct. 1, a lone gunman unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of bullets down on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500 others. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.
The shooter — 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada — acted alone, police said. Investigators found 23 firearms in his room at the Mandalay Bay, and 19 more at his home. He was found after killing himself with a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.

On Nov. 5, an armor-clad shooter entered a church in rural Texas and opened fire, killing 26 parishioners and injuring at least 19 others.
6. Terrorism in Popular Tourist Destinations:Vehicular and suicide terrorist attacks hit some of Europe’s most popular tourist destinations, as well as the America’s most populous city this year.
In late March, three people were killed and about 40 were injured when an attacker rammed into pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge and attempted to enter Parliament wielding a knife. About two weeks later, an attacker killed four and injured 15 after intentionally driving into a department store in Stockholm, Sweden.
In May, children were among the 22 killed in a suicide bombing after an Ariana Grande concert at Britain’s Manchester Area. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since 2005. Almost two weeks later, seven people died and nearly 50 were injured when a vehicle rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge, and three attackers embarked on a stabbing spree at nearby Borough Market.
During August, 13 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in Spain when a van plowed into Barcelona’s La Rambla tourist destination, before another car hit several people and killed one woman in a resort further down the Spanish coast.
Terrorism again hit the U.S. on Oct. 31, when Sayfullo Saipov rented a pickup truck and deliberately mowed down pedestrians on a bike path in Lower Manhattan, killing eight and injuring about a dozen more, before crashing into a school bus. Officials said the terrorist attack was the deadliest in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.
7. The Opioid Epidemic:
In August, President Trump declared America’s opioid epidemic a national emergency two days after vowing the U.S. would “win” the fight against it.
About a month earlier, the Department of Justice charged more than 400 people who officials said were preying on addicts to shell out money for unnecessary treatments that only worsened their condition, and doctors who were allegedly prescribing unnecessary opioids.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently reported that the epidemic’s true cost in 2015 was $504 billion — more than six times the most recent estimate.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in late October that illegal, lab-made fentanyl contributed to the death of at least half of fatal opioid overdoses in 2016, underscoring how deadly the epidemic has become in recent years.
8.The Devastating Hurricane Season:A hurricane season unlike any other came to a close in December after causing billions of dollars in damages, devastating those who were impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria when they plowed through southeast Texas, Florida and the Caribbean.
Harvey, a Category 3 storm, drenched southeast Texas in late August with 1 million gallons of water per person in the region, according to The Associated Press. The storm caused historic flooding in Houston, where some downtown areas were knee-deep in water and portions of highways were shut down with 10 feet of water.
Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Irma ravaged Florida, devastating the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm before weakening. The storm also lead to the deaths of 12 patients at a Hollywood, Florida, nursing home. Those fatalities have since been ruled a homicide, officials said.
And at the end of September, the Category 4 Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in almost a century, steamrolled through the island, annihilating homes, knocking out the entire power grid and leaving many without electricity for months.
Maria’s aftermath also raised concerns about the relationship between Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and the small Montana energy firm that was helping Puerto Rico to rebuild its power grid, Whitefish Energy Holdings.
The island canceled its $300 million contract with the company in October after The Washington Post reported, among other things, that the company only had only two full-time employees when the storm made landfall
9.The Total Solar Eclipse:The astronomical phenomenon of the century lived up to the hype.The total solar eclipse shifted across the U.S. in late August, enchanting Americans in small towns and large stadiums from coast to coast. The nation was captivated by the first total solar eclipse to cross the U.S. since 1918.
viewers gazed at the eclipse as it carved a narrow “path of totality” from Salem, Oregon, to Charleston, South Carolina. The one rule was to look only through special glasses or projected reflections, but some — including the president — disregarded that sound advice.
10.The Culture Wars:Since President Trump took office, the partisan division that evidenced on the campaign trail translated into national culture wars, including debates over the merits of removing statues and building names that honor Confederate soldiers, as well as kneeling at football games to protest racial inequality.
On Aug. 12, white nationalists gathered in Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia, before a rally organized by a group known as “Unite the Right.” The rally’s purpose was to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
Later that day, a 32-year-old woman was killed and more than 19 others were injured after a car rammed into a group of counter-protesters who were demonstrating against the alt-right.
Trump denounced the series of events that unfolded in Charlottesville, but was criticized by the public and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for not fully condemning the protests’ white nationalist elements, which included appearances by former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke and white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.

“PML-N will have a historic win in the elections,” Sharif said to those in attendance.
“Our political opponents will fail in their intentions,” he said.
Pointing out the development work undertaken during his government, Nawaz said he delivered on his promises.
“We eliminated terrorism over the past four years, with the grace of Allah. Cricket returned to Lahore,” he said.However, the progress of Pakistan has come to a standstill ever since the Panama Papers decision, he lamented.

“We eliminated terrorism over the past four years, with the grace of Allah. Cricket returned to Lahore,” he said.
However, the progress of Pakistan has come to a standstill ever since the Panama Papers decision, Nawaz lamented.
The former premier lamented that Pervez Musharraf broke the Constitution but his case is still pending in the courts, yet “they gave the verdict against us in a matter of weeks.”
“We cannot go back now. We will only go forward. The youth will take Pakistan forward. Nobody can stop you except God,” Nawaz said.The PML-N leader said although Pakistan has been independent since its creation in 1947, its founder Quaid-e-Azam’s dream is yet to be realized to the full.
“Your future should be better than your past and present.”
The former prime minister also questioned his disqualification by the Supreme Court. “Where have you heard that a leader is disqualified because he did not receive a salary from his son?” Nawaz asked.
“A ladla (dear) is excused despite admitting to his crime,” Nawaz said in an apparent reference to Imran Khan.
Nawaz added that throughout the world people had the right to elect a government, but this was not the case in Pakistan. “Pakistan is a country where the offshore companies of some are halal and others haram.”Nawaz, addressing the social media convention, said the courts thankfully did not term Imran’s assets as Nawaz Sharif’s.
“And when he [Imran] accepts the assets as his, they say the assets are not yours.”

636,Greeks Call Strike Over Austerity and Bailout Reforms,https://abbtakk.tv/en/greeks-call-strike-over-austerity-and-bailout-reforms/,"December 14, 2017","Athens (December 14, 2017): Greeks walked off the job on Thursday in a nationwide strike protesting against austerity measures and reforms the leftist-led government has agreed with the country’s bailout lenders.
Domestic flights and Athens transport were disrupted, ships remained docked for 24 hours and some public services were shut by the strike organized by Greece’s largest labor unions, private sector GSEE and its public sector counterpart ADEDY.
The two unions have staged repeated strikes since the first bailout in 2010 but participation has been low in recent years due to inertia and austerity fatigue after three rescue packages and five snap elections in eight years.
Around midday, about 10,000 striking workers, pensioners and students marched peacefully to parliament where lawmakers have been debating the 2018 budget. A vote on the draft is scheduled for next week.
They chanted: “Take your bailouts and get out of here.” Protesters held banners reading “Shame on you!” and “No more lies!”.
Greece’s fiscal goals have been approved by its European Union lenders and the International Monetary Fund.
Under its latest bailout review, the government has agreed to cut spending further, reduce pensions, complete an evaluation of public sector staff’s skills and qualifications and sell coal-fired power stations. It will also tighten the rules for unions to call a strike.
“Hands off unions!,” chanted some of the protesters.
The state had adopted “ruthless dead end policies which were strangling the Greek people”, GSEE said in a statement.
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks have lost their jobs during the crisis and a deep recession induced by austerity. Pensioners have seen their income slashed by more than 30 percent.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won power in 2015 on promises to end austerity but later signed up to a new 86 billion euro bailout that ends in August. He was re-elected on pledges to protect the poor and pensioners as well as workers’ wages and rights.
With his Syriza party’s popularity sliding in opinion polls, Tsipras, whose term ends in 2019, wants to attempt “a clean exit” from the bailout, without additional financial aid from the lenders that usually comes with more conditions.

He had recalled that the elections were held on June 12 and that on May 13 the party had amended its constitution.
The petitioner had said that the PTI had not completed the necessary legal formalities when amending the constitution.
He had added that the party’s constitution can only be changed if there is a two-thirds majority from the Central Executive Council.
The lawyer was referring to an amendment which gave registered voters just two choices: panel 1 or 2.

Rafique’s statement referred to the presentation of a constitutional amendment to the delimitation bill in the Senate, where the PPP has a majority. The bill was earlier passed by the lower house as the PML-N holds a majority.
He added that the decision on who will lead a political party should be made by the party workers and not “behind closed doors”.Elaborating on his statements, the PML-N leader said the law to bar a disqualified individual from leading a political party was first formulated during former president Ayub Khan’s era and was then introduced during Musharraf’s tenure.
“Both the dictators wanted to bar popular politicians of their time from contesting the elections, hence they introduced the law,” said Rafique.The PML-N stalwart further said that all political parties were on the same page regarding the bill.
He also criticised the PPP for voting against the founding leader of their party.
Referring to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf’s Chairman Imran Khan, Rafique said Imran does not understand politics and is using lies and accusations to try and come into power.
“I am very clear about Imran, he will shake hands with the devil for coming to power,” added the PML-N leader.
The Senate has twice postponed the voting on the bill for delimitation of constituencies due to low attendance.At least 69 votes are required to get the Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2017 approved, which pertains to the fresh delimitation of constituencies in line with the provisional results of the latest census in light of the general elections next year.
According to the new delimitation of constituencies, Punjab’s seat share in the National Assembly will decrease by nine seats, while Islamabad will get one more seat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa five and Balochistan three more.
NA seats for FATA and Sindh will remain unchanged.

During the meeting, chaired by Imran Khan, it was claimed that during its tenure, the federal and Punjab governments had distributed Rs200 billion among national and provincial ministers from discretionary funds.
Distributing such large volumes of funds among ministers ahead of the general elections amounts to pre-poll rigging, the PTI leadership concluded.

The consultative meeting, to be held at the Religious Affairs Ministry, is the latest effort on behalf of the government to bring the protest to a peaceful end.
Sources said the meeting will have a single-point agenda: how to resolve the crisis in the capital.
Iqbal, Pakistan Muslim League-N leader Raja Zafarul Haq and State Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Aminul Hasnaat have previously met a number of protest leaders in view of reaching a breakthrough to end the sit-in.The interior minister in his press conference on Sunday said that all options are available for dispersing the Islamabad protest, adding that a security operation is the last option as the government will try to avoid bloodshed.
Addressing the media alongside State Minister for Religious Affairs, Iqbal had said the government will go “to any extent” to resolve the issue, including a security operation, adding that protesters blocking the Faizabad Interchange are engaging in a propaganda to incite emotions of the people.
“Our forces have the capability to clear the area but we are keeping the operation as the last option. This is not a sign of weakness but we are doing this out of respect [for the matter of finality of Prophethood].”The protest has nothing to do with religion or religious demands and “such organisations” take these steps to advance ahead of elections, he said.
“The protesters demand that Law Minister Zahid Hamid should step down; however, there is no proof that he is responsible for the mistake. A committee has been formed in this regard which will probe the matter so there is no justification for the protest,” he said.

“Our forces have the capability to clear the area but we are keeping the operation as the last option. This is not a sign of weakness but we are doing this out of respect [for the matter of finality of Prophethood].”
He accused the protesters of Islamabad sit-in of inciting people through propaganda on social media, rejecting the impression that government has allowed any flexibility on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.
“There is no lacuna in the law relating to Khatm-e-Nabuwwat,”
The minister who was flanked by Peer Ameenul Hasnat, Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, said , “No government can compromise on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat. Khatm-e-Nabuwwat is part of our faith”
The interior minister said the parliament and the people of the country were custodian of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.
Ahsan Iqbal said inciting religious sentiments was not appropriate, adding that Pakistan’s enemies are taking advantage of the image created by the protesters.“We have showed restraint,”  he said in response to a question and appealed to the religious leaders to call off the sit-in as Islamabad was going to host foreign dignitaries at Joint Coordination Committee meeting on Monday.
He said although the entire nation was united on the issue of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat, the protesters have created the impression though their sit-in that the nation was divided on the issue.
The protest has nothing to do with religion or religious demands and “such organisations” take these steps to advance ahead of elections, he said.
“The protesters’ demand that Law Minister Zahid Hamid step down; however, there is no proof that he is responsible for the mistake. A committee has been formed in this regard which will probe the matter so there is no justification for the protest,” he said.
In response to a question, the minister said they have intelligence reports that some elements among the protesters want the government to take action so they can further their hidden agenda.He added that the government is fully capable of countering the protesters but is choosing restraint.
The interior minister, began the news press by reiterating that the government firmly believes in the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat (finality of Prophethood) law, adding that Parliament and nation are united on the matter.
“It is settled forever [for Pakistan] that a person who doesn’t believe in the finality of Prophethood has no right to call himself Muslim. All political parties unanimously passed the law in this regard. There is no justification now for the protest to continue,” he said.
Calling upon protesters once again to call off the sit-in, he said that he hopes they will agree to the suggestions made by the religious personalities included in talks, adding that now he himself is conducting contempt of court by allowing the protest to continue.
“I requested the court for more time all for good cause,” he said.At present, negotiations between a select group of religious leaders and the protesters are under way.
The minister, along with others, has been engaged in negotiations with the protesters, who have occupied the key Faizabad Interchange of the capital for nearly two weeks, but failed to reach a breakthrough.
However, addressing the media later Saturday night after hectic rounds of negotiations, Iqbal said he was hopeful of resolving the matter in a day.
The religious parties have been protesting against the change in the finality of Prophethood oath in the law when the government passed the Elections Act 2017 last month. The change, dubbed a clerical error by the government, was immediately fixed as an amendment was passed later.However, the protesters have demanded that Law Minister Zahid Hamid, who introduced the bill, resign. They also want responsibility fixed on other officials involved in the incident.
The protest has disrupted life in the capital and Rawalpindi, causing inconvenience as well as at least two reported casualties due to ambulances being unable to cross the protesters.
The Islamabad High Court had given the government until 10am November 18 to remove the protesters ‘with force if need be’ but the government did not do so and instead opted for negotiations to find a peaceful way out.
According to sources on Saturday night, the protesters have refused to budge from their demand for the law minister’s resignation, saying they will engage in talks once Hamid has been sacked.
However, Iqbal said on Saturday the law minister will not be sacked until his guilt is proven.

The court issued the direction in the case, filed by Election Commission seeking action against Rahman Malik for concealing his dual nationality.
During today’s hearing the court expressed anger at Malik’s absence, on which Rahman’s counsel assured the court that his client will appear before the court on next hearing.Challenging the judgment of the Judge of Session Court Election Commission argues that Malik was exonerated by the Session Court ex parte.
The Election Commission also pleads the Sindh High Court to declare Rahman Malik disqualified and to order him pay back the salaries and the benefits.It may be mentioned here that Pakistan’s Constitution bars a foreign national (or dual nationality holder) from holding any public office of the Government of Pakistan. The Supreme Court of Pakistan retroactively suspended and terminated the electoral membership of Farahnaz Ispahani over the issue of dual nationality on 25 May 2012.In a reference filed against Malik, the Supreme Court began the hearings against Malik over the suspicion of his British nationality. Effectively, the then chief justice Pakistan Iftikhar Chaudhry suspended the electoral membership of Malik when he had shown reluctance to submit a declaration by the United Kingdom’s Border Agency to establish that his client had surrendered British nationality on 6 June 2012. Despite the Supreme Court’s verdict, he was reinstated by Prime Minister Gillani after issuing directives to the cabinet division to reinstate him as an advisor to the prime minister on interior affairs.On 5 October 2012, Malik informed the Supreme Court that he had renounced his British citizenship on 25 March 2008.
Shortly after the verdict, Malik tendered his resignation to the Senate to Chairman Senate on 10 July 2012. He continued his work with the Ministry of Interior at the behest of then prime minister Pervez Ashraf.On 4 June, his membership in the Senate was suspended by the Supreme Court for being a dual national. This resulted in the loss of his position as the Interior Minister, because Article 63-A of the Constitution of Pakistan requires each member of the cabinet to be a member of the Parliament. On 10 July 2012, Malik resigned from the Senate.
It may be mentioned here that Rahman Malik took oath as Senator on in March 2015 and will complete his renure in March 2021.

Section 7B states that the status of Ahmedis remains as stated in the Constitution of Pakistan, while section 7C states that if an enrolled voter’s belief in the finality of Prophet Muhammad’s prophethood is contended, they shall have to sign a declaration reaffirming their belief, failing which their “name shall be deleted from the joint electoral rolls and added to a supplementary list of voters in the same electoral area as non-Muslim.”
During address, the law minister said that before 2002 general elections, seats were increased and collective polls were approved. He clarified that the same status of Ahmadiyya and Lahori groups will be retained as in Constitution.He told his only concern was that to remove the 10-day limit to submit the declaration of Khatm-e-Nubuwwat, adding that the bill restored the clause in its original form. He said that both declaration have been made part of election act.

He told that he had to issue a video message for his constituency. He also said, “I and my family are ready to sacrifice our lives for the sanctity of Prophet (PBUH).”
He demanded of revealing the name of those who were responsible for the mistake, adding that no compromise can be made in the matter. He said that he recommendations of committee chaired by Raja Zafar-ul-Haq should be put forward in the assembly.
Hamid said that the new, amended bill will make the said sections more effective, adding that a separate voters list shall be created for Ahmadis as they will not be included in the list for Muslims.While Zahid Hamid was clarifying his stance on the serious concern, Sheikh Rasheed chanted slogans against the government at which Speaker Ayaz Sadiq turned off his microphone. “We have not asked Law Minister Zahid Hamid to clarify the matter,” said Sheikh Rasheed.
The Khatm-i-Nabuwat declaration has also been restored to original form in both English and Urdu, he assured.
The Elections Act 2017 — which paved the way for Nawaz Sharif to return as PML-N president — had become a cause of controversy when it was revealed that a declaration regarding the finality of prophethood had been modified somewhere during the process of its passage.
Earlier, Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered the religious parties staging sit-in at Faizabad for the last 10 days to end their sit-in protest.

While returning the petition, the Registrar office said that the petitioner must approach the appropriate forum first.
The Registrar Office observed that without going to the concerned forum first petition cannot be filed directly in the apex court.
It is to be mentioned here that the PTI chief has filed a petition under Article 184/3 of the Constitution in the apex court against the Election Reforms Act 2017.Khan argued that the amendments in the Act are in violation of the constitution as a disqualified legislator cannot become the chief of a political party.
By passing an amendment to the law, which generally pertains to the holding of polls in the country, the ruling party had allowed ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif to regain leadership of the party. The PTI leader added that the Act is against the Political Parties Order 2002, and in direct conflict with Article 204 and 175 of the Constitution.The petition said that the former prime minister had to resign from his position as party leader after the verdict of the Panama Papers case disqualified him from parliament.
Khan appealed to the court to eliminate Articles 9, 10 and 203 of Election Reforms Act, as he believed that these amendments were put forward to provide Nawaz with the constitutional cover he needed to become party chief again.
The intra-party election of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) was held after the National Assembly passed the Elections Bill 2017 and this allowed Nawaz to regain the chairmanship of the ruling party.

“Musharraf conveyed this message before and it is still there today,” he said, adding that doing so will help the MQM get into the national fold.
The APML leader said Musharraf was offered to lead the MQM in the past, but he declined to assume leadership of the MQM and PSP.

“If they become part of our alliance, then Musharraf may assume role of [their] leader,” he said.On October 23, chief of All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf had announced to return to Pakistan before next general elections.

677,PML-N Bound To Accept All Decisions of Nawaz: Shahbaz,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pml-n-bound-to-accept-all-decisions-of-nawaz-shahbaz/,"November 7, 2017","Lahore (November 7, 2017): Punjab chief minister (CM) Shahbaz Sharif has said on Tuesday that Nawaz Sharif, ousted premier of Pakistan, is the leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and whatever decisions he takes in whichever situation, the party would accept it.
Speaking to the media after inaugurating a kidney transplant facility in Lahore on Tuesday, he said the opponents have not been able to prove corruption of even a single penny against the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Sharif family.

Criticizing Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, Shahbaz Sharif said that he was involved in the embezzlement of Rs6 billion of tax-payers’ money and urged him to refrain from issuing suggestive statements.
He declared the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province a failure by saying that those who have called for premature General Elections 2018 have not delivered on their promises to the people of the province.
Had PML-N been in power in KP province, there would have been hospitals erected there as well, like those in Punjab, CM Shahbaz added.
Clearing questions about his relation with former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the chief minister said that the Chakri politician is his good friend and that he would be invited to inaugurate the facility once constructed.While talking about the scam involving multiple companies in Punjab, the chief minister said that he would let out details about the issue in coming days. He said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan is not appearing before courts in defamation suit after wrongly accusing him of Rs 10 billion worth of corruption.
He asserted that Khan is calling for premature elections only to see Orange Line Train remain an incomplete project.
He alleged PTI of attempting to devoid Punjab of the development that is underway on multiple fronts after leaving Khyber Pakhtunkhwa disappointed.
He also talked about the ongoing smog issues in the province and admitted that the precautionary measures that were to be taken were ignored.
The chief minister said that Mr. Niazi of NICL is among those people who are named in Paradise Leak. He further said that there are ‘many characters’ in play in Paradise Leak.Punjab chief minister concluded his media talk by saying that the allegations against co-chairman of Pakistan People’s Party and former president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari are not mere accusations but the truth about him.
In the present situation, only PML-N is being tried in the accountability dock whereas investigations amount to accountability only if the parametres are the same for all the political parties.
While talking about Kidney and Liver Transplant Centre, CM Shahbaz said that the first phase of the facility would be constructed by December 25th and that the institute comprises of at least 360 beds.
In an apparent attempt to tone down reports of power tussle between Sharif brothers, Shahbaz said he would abide by all decisions of his elder brother Nawaz Sharif – the deposed prime minister who is also the ruling party’s chairman.In high-level party huddle in London last month, the ousted premier was reportedly unhappy with the Punjab CM and his son Hamza Shababz’s cold response to the reconciliation efforts of his daughter Maryam Nawaz.
During the meetings in London, Shahbaz was said to have minced no words in assuring his elder brother that he always stood by his side and would continue to do so, but also said that the way loyalists were marginalised in the party at the expense of promoting the ‘paratroopers’ was costing the PML-N dearly.
The former prime minister was further urged by his younger brother that he needed to differentiate between those who sacrificed for the party in the past to keep it intact and those who brought the party to the point where it was today — on the verge of isolation.
The elder Sharif reportedly sounded unhappy mentioning that senior cabinet members and party leaders were openly criticising his policies and putting their weight behind his younger brother.

The seat had fallen vacant after the death of dissident PTI MNA Gulzar Khan on Aug 28.
At some polling stations of the constituency, polling started with delay.
The by-election is considered as litmus test of the ruling PTI and its government over 4-year performance in the province.Strict security arrangements have been made by the administration for the by-elections. Deputy Commissioner Peshawar has banned brandishing and displaying of arms and rallies in the constituency by imposing Sec-144.

Analysts said that the NA-4 Peshawar is for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) what NA-120 Lahore was for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in last month’s by-election.
Victory in the by-election would be a verdict on its four-year rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and losing the election would not only be demoralising but would also give a boost to its political foes, waiting eagerly to regain their lost territory.Not surprisingly, therefore, both parties have thrown their full political might and resources into the contest. Both have pumped massive federal and provincial funds into NA-4 for launching new projects, or to complete the ongoing ones before schedule. Gulzar’s son, Asad Gulzar, is also on the list but he is contesting election on PPP ticket, which he recently joined.

One side of the constituency connects to GT Road via Chamkani, while the other meets Pabbi, Nowshera. The area of Badbher connects the constituency with Khyber Agency, while the route of Mattani joins it to Darra Adam Khel in Frontier Region Kohat.The geographic location of the constituency and terrorism incidents that have taken place there in the past are the reason why all the polling stations there have been declared sensitive while 182 have been marked as ‘most sensitive’.The constituency is home to around 600,000 people who call it a hub of problems as gas and electricity load-shedding and lack of potable water and schools for girls have made their routine life difficult.
In the heart of the constituency is situated Sher Shah Suri Road where vehicles can be seen struggling their way through the rickety path around Phandu Chowk.As far as security arrangements are concerned, Pakistan Army personnel will be deployed inside and outside at all the polling stations of the NA-4, Peshawar-IV by-election.

706,"Senate Passes The Elections Amendment Bill, 2017",https://abbtakk.tv/en/329588-2senate-passes-the-elections-amendment-bill-2017/,"October 23, 2017","Islamabad (October 23, 2017): The Senate on Monday approved an amendment to clause 203 of the Elections Bill 2017, barring a disqualified person from heading a political party.
During the Senate session, opposition parties tabled amendments to the much-debated clause of the previously approved Elections Bill 2017.
Clause 203 of the Elections Bill 2017 pertains to membership of political parties, which allows every citizen to have the right to form or be a member or office-bearer of a political party, despite the person being out of the service of Pakistan.
However, the amendment tabled in the Senate suggests that a person who is not eligible to become a member of the Parliament cannot head a political party.
The amended bill was opposed by the government with Federal Minister of Law Zahid Hamid expressing reservations.However, it was passed with a clear majority of 49, including leaders from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, voting in favour of the amendment.
Earlier in the Senate, on October 11, a resolution was passed on the same matter.
The resolution, presented by Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Aitzaz Ahsan, stated that a person who is not eligible to become a member of the Parliament or has been disqualified cannot lead any political party.
The step was taken against the approval given to ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif to head the ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, after amendments were made to the Elections Bill, 2017.
PML-N Senator Mushahidullah Khan reacted to development on the Elections Bill, 2017, saying such a resolution, which called for distancing a leader from its people, meant nothing to them.He added passing of the amended bill meant “Bhuttoism has lost” while “Musharraf and Ayubism won”.
However, the senator said, people of Pakistan still consider Nawaz Sharif their leader.
The bill moved by Taj Haider and others provides to amend the Election Act 2017.
The Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2017,” the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2017,” the Federal Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2017,” the National Commission on the Status of Women (Amendment) Bill, 2017, the Prevention and Management of Conflict of Interest Bill, 2017″ were also introduced in the house today.

Talking to media, the minister said that he stuck to his stance that Shahbaz should take over the party which he said is in the best interest of the party and country.
“Shehbaz Sharif is an obedient brother and that’s why he said that he should take over the party and I still adhere to my statements,” said Pirzada.
He said that there is no double meaning or conspiracy behind his words. Regarding criticism of his statement, he said that he did not call upon a Brigadier Shahbaz Sharif to take over or 111 brigade to take over PML-N rather an obedient brother of Nawaz Sharif to take charge of party.
“We don’t object to Nawaz’s leadership but we are concerned how the party will go into the next elections,” said Pirzada.
Earlier in an apparent sign of a revolt, Pirzada suggested that the Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz would be the best choice to lead the party.
He said that there will be a vacuum in the party if Shehbaz Sharif was not made the president. Shehbaz Sharif’s advice to the party should be accepted, as he was dealing with the public opinion in a better way, he added.

708,Shinzo Abe Secures Victory in Japan Snap Election,https://abbtakk.tv/en/shinzo-abe-secures-victory-in-japan-snap-election/,"October 22, 2017","Tokyo (October 22, 2017): Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swept to a comfortable victory in a snap election on Sunday, handing him a mandate to harden his already hawkish stance on North Korea and re-energise the world’s number-three economy.
Abe’s conservative coalition was on track to win 311 seats in the 465-seat parliament, according to a projection published by private broadcaster TBS, putting the nationalist blue blood on course to become Japan’s longest-serving leader.
The comfortable election win is likely to stiffen Abe’s resolve to tackle North Korea’s nuclear menace, as the key US regional ally seeks to exert maximum pressure on the regime in Pyongyang after it fired two missiles over Japan in the space of a month.

Abe was heading for a “landslide win,” the Yomiuri daily said on its website.
Millions of Japanese braved torrential rain and driving winds to vote, as a typhoon bears down on the country with many heeding warnings to cast their ballots early.
Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) benefitted from a weak and splintered opposition, with the two main parties facing him created only a matter of weeks ago.
Support for the Party of Hope founded by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike fizzled after an initial blaze of publicity and was on track to win around 50 seats, the TBS projection suggested.
Speaking from Paris where she was attending an event in her capacity as leader of the world’s biggest city, a sullen-faced Koike told public broadcaster NHK she feared a “very severe result”.
The new centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party fared slightly better than expected but was still far behind Abe.
It was unclear in the immediate aftermath of the vote whether Abe’s coalition would retain its two-thirds “supermajority.”
Such a “supermajority” would allow Abe to propose changes to Japan’s US-imposed constitution that forces it to “renounce” war and effectively limits its military to a self-defence role.
The short 12-day campaign was dominated by the economy and the global crisis over North Korea, which has threatened to “sink” Japan into the sea.
Nationalist Abe stuck to a hardline stance throughout, stressing that Japan “would not waver” in the face of an increasingly belligerent regime in Pyongyang.
Despite the sabre-rattling from North Korea, many voters said reviving the once-mighty Japanese economy was the top priority, with Abe’s trademark “Abenomics” policy failing to trickle down to the general public.

The three-pronged combination of ultra-loose monetary policy, huge government spending and structural reform has catapulted the stock market to a 21-year high but failed to stoke inflation and growth has remained sluggish.
Although voters turned out in their millions to back Abe, support for the 63-year-old is lukewarm and surveys showed his decision to call a snap election a year earlier than expected was unpopular.
Koike briefly promised to shake up Japan’s sleepy political scene with her new party but she declined to run herself for a seat, sparking confusion over who would be prime minister if she won.
In the end, the 65-year-old former TV presenter was not even in Japan on election day.
The campaign was marked by a near-constant drizzle in large parts of the country and rallies frequently took place under shelter and a sea of umbrellas.
But this did not dampen the enthusiasm of hundreds of doughty, sash-wearing parliamentary hopefuls, who have driven around in minibuses pleading for votes via loudspeaker and bowing deeply to every potential voter.

“The enemy wants Muslims to behead each other. If we continue treading this path of violence and unrest, we wouldn’t even need an [external] enemy to destroy us,” he said while addressing joint press conference law minister Zahid Hamid.
Federal Minister said social networking websites were being used to issue fatwas calling for killing others over blasphemy.
He added that the people issuing such edicts on the internet could not claim ownership of faith. “They will be dealt with sternly under the cyber crime law,” he maintained.

He added that enemies of the state want Muslims pitted against each other. “We need to prevent that from happening and I humbly request religious leaders to condemn the fatwas posted on social media.”
“If we start handing out fatwas on kufr [cardinal sin] in every street and neighbourhood, and the maulvi in every street mosque starts handing out fatwas about who is kafir [an apostate] and who is Muslim, then [there will be chaos]. It is only up to God to decide who is going to heaven and hell — it is not our job,” Ahsan thundered.
“We need to unite to defeat terrorism. If we remain at each other’s throats, then we will achieve nothing but self-destruction.”
Ahsan Iqbal further explained that: “Finality of prophet-hood is such an article of faith, it is such a base and pillar of faith that even thinking of compromising on it is itself apostasy.”
He then went on to repeat that only the state has the right to declare who is Muslim and who is not.

“State has monopoly over three things. It decides who is Muslim and who is not. As you know when Qadianis were declared non-Muslims, it happened through parliament.”
He clarified that the amendment to the Elections Act 2017 was made unanimously after political parties noted the technical change.
Iqbal also condemned social media users targeting the former prime ministers and members of the cabinet and declaring them non-Muslims.
He said that security forces were working towards arresting the facilitators of the blast, adding “The country is telling the sponsors of terrorism that their cowardly attempts [at creating fear] will not crush our defiant spirit.”
At least 20 people lost their lives in the suicide bombing that took place at the entrance to the dargah at a time when scores of people had gathered to pay their respects.
Talking on the occasion law minister Zahid Hamid pointed out that the electoral reform bill was approved after the consultation with all political parties, however the nomination papers farm has been restored in its original shape.
“We should purify our soil from the elements who are creating hates among the people as streets could not make decision and real decision rest upon the state,” he said.

According to the details, PTI chief Imran Khan said that the political party would attempt to block the electoral reforms bill in the National Assembly. He had earlier branded failure to block the bill in the Senate an embarrassment for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and reiterated the statement today in the press conference.
Speaking to the media, the PTI chief said he was contacting other opposition parties to invite them to challenge the bill, which had been passed with a majority vote by Senate last month after a key amendment proposed by the PPP to retain a clause resurrected by retired Gen Pervez Mushar­raf through the Political Parties Order 2002 was rejected.

Under the bill, the legal bar on a person to serve as an office-bearer of a political party if he is either not qualified to be, or disqualified from being, elected as a member of parliament under Article 63 of the Constitution was removed, paving the way for an otherwise ineligible Nawaz Sharif to head his own faction of the Pakistan Muslim League.
“This bill will provide an opportunity to a criminal to become the head of a party,” Khan said, referring to the former prime minister. “You are creating a law for a criminal,” Khan said, adding that the moral conscience of the country was being jeopardised.
“Does this happen in democracies? Democracy means transparency,” Khan said, threatening to approach the courts if the ruling party attempted to bulldoze the bill through the National Assembly. Khan also said that he had “already planned rallies” in case of such an eventuality.
Criticising the ruling PML-N on several fronts, the PTI chief also reiterated his call for fresh elections.
He said that Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal had staged a “drama” in the capital today as Nawaz appeared before an accountability court for a hearing regarding several graft cases opened against him.
“Rangers have suddenly appeared and taken over this place,” Iqbal had said as he lashed out at the paramilitary force for barring PML-N leaders, lawyers and supporters of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif from entering an accountability court in Islamabad.
Khan said Iqbal’s statement would create conflict among the country’s institutions.The PTI chief also spoke in reference to the on-going case against him in the Supreme Court, which seeks his disqualification over the non-disclosure of assets, ownership of offshore companies and receiving foreign funding for his party.
Khan claimed that he had submitted complete details of his finances and documents pertaining to the money trail for his Draycott Flat in London.
“I am being compared to the country’s biggest criminal,” Khan said, again referring to the former prime minister.The PTI chief said that while the Sharif family had not submitted any evidence or money trail before the apex court during the Panama Papers case, he had done so in the disqualification case against him — a statement found wanting by the Supreme Court, which has directed him to establish, beyond a doubt, how a considerable sum of money was transferred to Khan’s ex-wife, Jemima Khan.
He hailed vice chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Shah Mehmood Qureshi the best parliamentarian and branded him the best potential opposition leader for the House.
Khan claimed that a fresh election could save the country from anymore trouble. He said that PTI would approach other political parties to check the reforms bill in the National Assembly.He said that democracy would suffer if Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz opens its doors to criminals.
PTI chief asserted that the lawmakers were criticising the armed forces for no reason. He rhetorically asked if Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had the only responsibility of protecting a criminal, Nawaz Sharif.
Nowhere in the world a disqualified leader in the re-elected as the party president, Khan complained.
Earlier in the day, PTI leaders had criticised the interior minister.
PTI Spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry had expressed satisfaction with the way things are proceeding in the accountability court hearing corruption cases against the Sharif family.
Speaking to Geo News on Monday after Nawaz’s hearing, he said he wonders whether the interior minister is a police officer that he went to the court today.
Similarly, PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the interior minister should not threaten to resign and instead just resign.

“It is saddening to hear Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi say that Nawaz is his PM.”
We are scared regarding the situation in the country, he said, adding that the country’s economy is in a harrowing condition.
On the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017, which was passed in the Senate on September 22, he remarked that the bill seeks to ridicule the democracy.
The bill also enables the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to scrutinise election expenses within 90 days, failing which election expenses submitted by a political party would be deemed to be correct. The bill also states that any parliamentary could only be disqualified for a period of five years.

According to the details, PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari said that if former president Pervez Musharraf is “so brave” he should return to the country and face the courts.
Zardari was speaking to the media a day after Musharraf directly accused him of being complicit in Benazir Bhutto’s assassination.

Continuing his criticism of the former president, Zardari questioned why were clips of Musharraf in discos being circulated if he had gone to seek treatment for his backache.
Zardari, reacting to allegations pertaining to Murtuza Bhutto’s murder, stated that Benazir had said that one Bhutto has been attacked and another is being targeted.
“Politics of the past was based on levelling allegations against political opponents,” Zardari added.
During his Friday press conference, the PPP leader said that the problems of the country can only be solved through a complete understanding of economic growth, which, he said, the ruling government lacks.He also criticised the PML-N for not having an appointed a foreign minister earlier. He said that Khawaja Asif ─ who was appointed as foreign minister in Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s cabinet in August ─ could not hold meaningful dialogue with other countries as they are aware that Asif may not retain his post after the General Election 2018.
“They have purposefully weakened Pakistan’s case,” Zardari said.
“The youth needs us, the youth needs jobs. They have no understanding. Nothing will come off building roads, how will we pay off our debts?” Zardari said, criticising what he sees are the incumbent government’s ‘faults’.
Zardari even criticised his political opponents; former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairperson Imran Khan.
When asked about Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan’s recently launched campaign against him, Zardari said: “I, too, am going to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” He also criticised the PTI for not implementing enough development projects in the province.
Over the development in PTI-governed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zardari said that “we can’t see any progress in the province.”
He remarked: “Nawaz does not know the art of governance. Nothing happens from building roads.”
Speaking about Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who is being probed by National Accountability Bureau, he said that Dar has fled and left the country injured.Speaking over the issue, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira remarked that “we condemn and criticise false allegations levelled by Pervez Musharraf.”
Kaira further added, “Musharraf remembered his earlier allegations once we approached the courts.”
On Thursday, Musharraf had Asif Ali Zardari for the murder of his wife and former premier Benazir Bhutto.
In a video message, Musharraf, the former army chief, said he was sending out this message as Zardari had personally called him out by blaming him for Benazir’s murder.Giving his ‘reply’, Musharraf said he is especially addressing [Benazir and Zardari’s children] Bilawal, Aseefa and Bakhtawar, as well as the Bhutto family and all Sindhis and Pakistanis who have been following “this murderer of Benazir”.

On September 18, Zardari had challenged the August 31 verdict passed by a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court in Bhutto’s murder case.
In his petition, filed before the Lahore High Court, Zardari had sought the death penalty for Musharraf and two senior police officers who were sentenced by the ATC to 17 years in prison in connection with Bhutto’s murder.

PPP lawyer Latif Khosa filed three applications in Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench against the acquittal of accused in Benazir murder case.

“She had said that Musharraf would be directly responsible in case anything happened to her,” reiterated Khosa.He also claimed that Musharraf got Saud Aziz, one of the two police officials punished in the case, posted as the Rawalpindi city police officer to ensure his role in the assassination. He accused Aziz of ordering the removal of a security cordon around Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007 so Benazir could be easily killed.
Khosa explained that they have filed three appeals: one challenges the order separating Musharraf’s trial from the case, the other is against the ‘lenient’ sentences against the police officers and the last against the suspected militants exonerated in the case.On September 11, the LHC’s Rawalpindi bench accepted for hearing appeals submitted by the two policemen convicted in the case.
Saud Aziz and Khurram Shahzad were sentenced to 17 years each and ordered to pay a fine of Rs0.5 million each for their negligence in investigating the case properly. Shahzad was SP Rawal Town at the time of the incident.Bhutto, the PPP chief and two-time former prime minister, was assassinated in a suicide attack at an election campaign rally in Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007.
An FIR over the incident was registered on behalf of the state following which the murder trial of five suspects began in February of 2008. However, once PPP won the 2008 elections, the investigation was handed over to the FIA.

“The ECP ban is comprises of hypothetical and against the facts as the political workers can’t be stopped to run election campaign on basis of hypothesis,” he said in his plea adding that public leader did not come under the service of Pakistan law.
Malik, who is managing Kulsoom Nawaz’s campaign in NA-120 while she undergoes treatment for lymphoma in London, argued that the ECP’s August 1 notification restricting MNAs and MPAs from entering NA-120 is against his fundamental rights and, therefore, should be withdrawn.
The notification violates Articles 15, 16, 17 and 19 of the Constitution, which guarantee every citizen the freedom of movement, assembly association and speech, his application said.The notification, he argued, is based on the assumption “that public office holders of a political party may indulge in corrupt or illegal practices” and “unduly influence the electorate” using public funds and resources and that the assumption cannot be used to strip a political party or a leader of their right to campaign.
The application said that the commission can define guidelines which ensure transparent practices during election, but “cannot restrict political activity.”Malik is an MNA from NA-123 Lahore and is at the forefront of PML-N’s campaign to win back the seat left vacant after disqualification of Nawaz Sharif via the July 28 Panamagate verdict.
A strong contest is expected in the constituency with the three biggest parties pushing for a win. Kulsoom is up against PTI’s Yasmeen Rashid and PPP’s Faisal Mir in the election, set to take place on September 17.

The NA received around 150 amendments proposed by political parties for the bill.
The house adopted amendments moved by the Law Minister including those having concurrence of the opposition members while other amendments of the opposition benches were rejected.

The bill consolidates eight election laws that would stand repealed once it becomes an act of parliament.
The reforms proposed in the bill include financial and administrative autonomy for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The bill envisages that citizens getting computerized National Identity Card from NADRA would automatically become voters.
The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted Election Bill 2017 envisaging wide-ranging reforms aimed at ensuring free, fair and transparent conduct of elections.Enabling provisions have been made for the Election Commission to conduct pilot project for utilization of Electronic Voting Machines and Biometric Verification and voting by Overseas Pakistanis.
Maximum limit of election expenses has been rationalized. New limits for expenses are 1.5 million rupees for election to a seat of Senate; four million for a seat of National Assembly and two million rupees for a seat of provincial assembly.
Under the bill, functions of the Caretaker Government have been confined to day to day, routine, non-controversial matters and shall not take major policy decisions except of urgent nature.
Political parties are required to allot at least five percent tickets against general seats to female candidates.
An amendment proposed by PTI, to allow overseas Pakistanis to vote in the general elections was rejected, which drew sharp criticism from the opposition party.“Overseas Pakistanis have as much right to vote as those living in Pakistan,” PTI leader Shafqat Mehmood said while addressing the media outside the assembly. “Despite our efforts, no action was taken to register overseas Pakistanis.”
Mehmood further stated that biometric verification is absolutely necessary but ‘it was deliberately slowed down and no real efforts were made to take the process ahead.’
The PTI leader, in his media address, said biometric identification was ‘doable,’ as telecommunication companies and multinationals have managed to implement the process but the ruling party, despite its ‘tall claims’ didn’t do anything.
“We voted against the bill and boycotted it because the proposed amendments are vital for the elections,” the PTI leader said.
Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid, in a media address outside the Parliament House said, “The National Assembly has passed a historic bill.”
“The positive aspect of this bill is that we have formed rules in collaboration with the Election Commission,” Hamid said. “We now have an election manual, and the elections won’t be delayed.”
He added that holding fair elections is the main purpose of the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017 for which, over 1200 recommendations were received from the public and lawmakers.
“We were unable to give overseas Pakistanis the right to vote,” he said, adding that electronic voting machines also failed during their test run in by-elections.Earlier, at the start of the session, Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah lashed out at the low presence of lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament.
Shah, a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said he was ashamed to see such a low level of attendance in the assembly today, when the lawmakers were expected to discuss the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017.
He said when the prime minister comes to attend the assembly session, others follow suit.
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, on the advice of Shah, the chief whip of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Sheikh Aftab Ahmed issued directives to bring the backbenchers to the front.

The statement added, that Umar was given a program to improve his fitness like other players before the West Indies tour and after he failed the tests in Lahore, he was left out of the team.After clearing another test before the squad selection on the eve of the ICC Champions Trophy in England, Umar was included in the eventual 15 member squad.
“The PCB wants to stress that the team trainer conducts fitness tests of squad members before each international assignment and the tests before the Champions Trophy were conducted as a continuation of the policy.
Once again Umar failed to attain the desired level of fitness and the team management was left with no option but to drop him from the squad.”Head Coach Mickey Arthur had placed Umar in his white ball format plans and gave him repeated chances for redemption, unfortunately, the batsman remained incapable of reaching the requisite fitness level.
The PCB awaits his response to the show cause issued to him yesterday and hopes that in the meantime, the batsman will refrain from making baseless allegations, the statement concluded.In late night posts on Twitter, Umar Akmal claimed that he had passed the fitness test for the Champions Trophy but after arriving in England Arthur took a dummy test and claimed Akmal had failed and sent him back.

Talking to media after visiting Mazar-e-Iqbal to offer Fatiha and lay floral wreath, the former Prime Minister criticized the decision of the apex court to oust him.

Nawaz also talked about his plan of constitutional amendments for reforming criminal justice system and ensuring easy access to justice.
He said that the circus being played for last 70 years should be shunned now, saying that otherwise it may harm the integrity of the country.
He said that Pakistan was created through the power of votes  but after the sad demise of Quaid-e-Azam and Shaheed-e-Millat Liaqat Ali Khan the country was de-tracked, which led to the dismembering of Pakistan in 1971.He said: “we learnt no lesson from Fall of Dhaka and the disrespect of people mandate and votes continued even today.”
He said that democracy was the name of respecting people votes and their choices.
The former PM added that had they respected the sanctity of votes, they would have not seen this day.
He added that during the last four years PML-N government delivered. Nawaz said that a sea of people took to streets to receive him and welcome him during his GT Road Rally. “The people have the realization that the country is moving forward on the path of development and progress,” he added.
Promising the public cheaper housing and access to justice, Ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif said that if his party was voted in during the next election.
Sharif lamented the invention of the Doctrine of Necessity, which he said “broke Pakistan apart”.
“We did not learn anything even when the country broke into two,” he added.“The time to bring Pakistan back to the Quaid’s path has come. We are late, but we need to decide that we will hold the vote valuable at any cost. We have to respect the law and Constitution if we must make Pakistan that of Quaid-i-Azam and Allama Iqbal’s vision.”
He asked whether the celebration of Pakistan’s independence really was a happy occasion this year.
“We would have been happy if East Pakistan was with us and progressing with us. Had we respected the sanctity of the vote, we would not have to see this day,” he claimed.
“We [the PML-N] have delivered in four years [of governance] and have not even completed five years as yet. People have seen that we have delivered; I have no doubt about this,” he said, going on to speak about eradication of terrorism, ending loadshedding in the country and economic progress ─ oft quoting election promises that he claimed to have delivered on during his tenure.
“The sea of people that travelled to Lahore with us from Islamabad didn’t follow us just like that. They could see the country was progressing and its needs were being fulfilled.”
The former PM touched upon promises that laid the base for his party’s next election campaign ─ providing the ordinary man access to justice, and free housing for those who cannot afford it.
“Our next agenda was even bigger than this [our last] ─ to give people inexpensive justice. Even if we have to amend the Constitution, I am ready for it,” he claimed.
“The cases against my grandfather which were initiated in his time are still being faced by his grandson, but no verdict ever comes, although all property was lost during the process,” he said. “This was not the purpose of creating Pakistan — it was not created so that people don’t receive social justice.”
“The state should help the poor who do not have the money to face legal cases. A constitutional amendment is required for this, which we will do. Whenever the next government is sworn in, we will keep this at the top of our agenda,” he vowed.
Adding to this, he said: “We will provide homes to those who cannot afford them. This is a wish I have held in my heart.”
“This land is owned by 200 million people, not just a handful of people. If some people have homes and property, then the rest should have the same,” he said. “We wish to strengthen the country economically.”
“You said in 2013 that there is no electricity. Did Nawaz Sharif not give you electricity? Did he not give you gas? Did he not decrease terrorism? Watch television programmes from 2012 to see the state of Pakistan then.”
“Although the federal government still comprises the PML-N, this [his disqualification] has been a huge setback and it will not be possible to achieve what we could have,” he claimed.
“I feel that if the drama that has been going on for 70 years does not end, Pakistan could face another tragic accident,” he warned. “The first item on Pakistan’s agenda should be to ensure that the sanctity of the vote is respected.”
According to former information minister, Senator Pervaiz Rasheed, Nawaz Sharif on Monday is also expected to “hold meetings with party leaders and discuss proposals, including whether to take out another procession from Lahore to Faisalabad or Multan, or Islamabad to Abbottabad or Peshawar in the second phase of the campaign”.

785,24 Killed in Post Election Violence in Kenya,https://abbtakk.tv/en/24-killed-in-post-election-violence-in-kenya/,"August 12, 2017","Nairobi (August 13, 2017): At least 24 people have been killed in Kenya in the violence that erupted after the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta, said Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.
“Specifically, these cases indicate that the casualties were felled by bullets and the same has been corroborated by family and community members who have indicated that they were killed during the protests which broke out in various parts of the country,” the independent rights group said in a statement. Of those death, 17 were killed in the capital Nairobi, the group said.

Kenyatta, the 55-year-old son of the country’s founding President, won a second five-year term Friday, defeating veteran opposition leader and longtime rival Raila Odinga in a tense contest.
Kenyatta, who promised to create 1.3 million jobs, got 54% of the vote while Odinga, who vowed to fight corruption, received 45%.
Protests and violence broke out almost immediately. Most of the demonstrators were supporters of 72-year-old former political prisoner Odinga, who has rejected the results of the presidential election, calling the vote rigged. National election officials have decried the accusations, saying the vote was free and credible.

Protests erupted in and around Kisumu, a stronghold of defeated opposition leader Odinga. Violence also broke out in Nairobi’s slum of Mathare, where tear gas and gunshots rang out all night, witnesses said.
Kenya Red Cross Society said that it had treated at least 93 people injured in the violence.

He termed the PML-N government as anti-worker and said it has least care about masses.

The board had originally given as many as 10 players, including seven centrally contracted cricketers, permission to play the entire Caribbean Premier League – which began on August 4 and runs until September 9. Three cricketers without central contracts – Kaman Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, and Muhammad Amir  and Muhammad Sami – have also been asked to return after they were selected by Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Lahore Whites for the National T20 Cup .

“The centrally contracted players were given permission to participate in the CPL and English county season subject to recall if the World XI series took place in mid-September,” the PCB said in a statement. “So they are being recalled owing to the changes in the schedule brought about due to the change in the original plan of the World XI’s tour of Pakistan.”
The World XI’s visit – subject to security clearance – was originally scheduled for the last week of September but it has been brought forward into a window between September 10 and 16. This change was made to ensure the series would not clash with a high profile by-election in Lahore on September 17, coming in the wake of the Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification from the post of Prime Minister last month.

However, the final call over the World XI matches is expected to be taken by the government. The Law and Order Committee of Punjab has reviewed the PCB’s request to host the series in Lahore and, according to Najam Sethi, the new chairman of the board, both parties are in agreement over dates and are waiting for the approval of the chief minister.
Pakistan are also set to travel to the UAE from September 21 for a full series against Sri Lanka. Amid this tight schedule, the PCB announced a National T20 Championship running from August 25 to September 10.

West Indian Board expressing anger over PCB decision started mulling over to not send their players for PSL. The Pakistani Cricketers, who are busy in CPL and English County, seem worry and said like present situation no foreign league will trust in Pakistani players.

While addressing a press conference in Lahore, Dr Rashid said that after the election schedule is announced, no change can be made to voter lists and no development can be done in the constituency according to the rules set by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

“Yet, when we asked for the voter lists, we were given a list that was updated till December 2016, which shows an increase of 30,000 voters over the past three years,” she said.
“However, when we asked for the estimated increase in voters over the past seven months [from December 2016 till July 2017], we were told that we should expect an increase of 25,000 to 30,000 voters.”
Dr Rashid wondered what could have happened that had caused the number of voters to swell by the same amount in the last seven months as it did in three years till December 2016.“We did not know how the electoral system works in this country in the 2013 elections; however, in the past three years, we have learned a lot. These signs I see tell me that pre-poll rigging is in full swing in NA-120,” Dr Rashid alleged.
Moving on to her other point of contention, Dr Rashid said, “The other problem is that they have not decided if they will use a biometric polling system or a manual one. They have suggested that they may use both — which is impractical and will affect the electoral results.”
“We have been pushing for a biometric system across the board, but there are just six weeks left in the election and people of the constituency have not been educated on how to use that system. This is another delaying tactic,” she alleged
During the same press conference, PTI leader Shafqat Mehmood said that PML-N should not investigate Ayesha Gulalai’s allegations against Imran Khan as they are the ones behind this “dirty campaign.”

“These people know that they have lost all political ground in the country to us and thus are resorting to such dirty tactics,” he said.
He added that this was his personal opinion, but he believed that although the party will have no objections to an inquiry in the matter, they would not want the PML-N to look into it as they are the ones behind the “bogus” allegations in the first place.
The seat had fallen vacant after the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif from holding public office by the Supreme Court and his subsequent de-notification by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

Either Ram Nath Kovind or Meira Kumar? The Presidential Election Polling has ended in India and the 776 MPs and 4120 MLAs votes in a secret ballot today will decide the President.

Some 4,900 legislators nationwide voted in what Modi termed a “historic” election to choose the titular head of state.
Ram Nath Kovind, the candidate of Modi´s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a former lawyer and state governor from the Dalit community, is certain to win.
His main rival is Meira Kumar, the nominee of the Congress-led opposition and also a Dalit.

But the BJP, which won a landslide in a general election in 2014, has for the first time assembled enough electoral college votes across the country to push through its presidential candidate. Congress has traditionally dominated the post.
Polling Began at 10 am Indian local time. As things stand, Kovind is likely to sweep the election with 70 per cent of the electoral college backing him. However, political parties cannot issue a whip to their members to vote for a particular nominee which means that cross-voting is possible.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah cast their votes at Parliament. Before casting his vote, Modi addressed the media, saying that the Monsoon Session, which begun today, brings ‘hope’.
Analysts said the elction of Kovind, 71, would help Modi tighten his grip on power and accrue political capital by sending an important message to the Dalits, a long-disdained electoral group once known as “untouchables”.
Dalits, who number around 200 million in the nation of 1.3 billion, are among India´s poorest communities and relegated to the margins of society.
Despite legal protection, discrimination is rife and Dalits are routinely denied access to education and other advancement opportunities.
Meanwhile, BJP is scheduled to hold a parliamentary board meeting at 6 pm to decide its Vice-Presidential candidate later today. The opposition has already picked former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi as its candidate.
The results of Presidential elections will be released on Thursday.

By-polls in PS-114 constituency of Karachi, scheduled on July 9, has triggered the political temperature of the country.
All the political parties are putting their full efforts and resources to convince 193,892 registered voters of the constituency. The by-election is being held after the victory of Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz’s Irfanullah Marwat was declared void by the election tribunal in July, 2014 after the runner-up, MQM’s Rauf Siddiqui challenged the result, alleging that the polls were rigged.

Marwat won the election with 37,130 votes, while runner-up Siddiqui secured 30,305 votes. Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had decided to re-poll in the constituency after National Database Registration Authority declared that above 17,000 fake votes were casted in the elections. Whereas the apex court uphold the ECP decision in May 2017. The seat had fallen vacant after the Supreme Court declared the election of PML-N’s Irfan Marwat from this constituency as null and void.

The constituency, situated in Karachi’s District East, is both ethnically and religiously diverse. Stepping into PS-114 is like stepping into a mini Pakistan – people from all over the country have settled in the area. This includes Sindhis, Baloch, Saraikis, Punjabis, Pakhtuns and Urdu-speaking people. The constituency is consisted of Mahmudabad, Manzoor Colony, Chanesar Goth, Azam Basti, Junejo town and parts of Kashmir Colony.

PML-N Irfanullah Marwat had won the elections in the constituency twice and MQM had won the seat once. It is pertinent to mention here that Irfanullah Marwat threw his weight behind Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s candidate Najeeb Haroon.

About 32 candidates are contesting the election but the main combat is expected among the candidates of Pakistan Peoples Party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMN-N), MQM Pakistan and Jamat-e-Islami .

Irfan Marwat had all set to join PPP but criticism of Asifa Bhutto Zardari and Bakhtawar Bhutto Zarda led him to change his decision. It seemed that Marwat took revenge by supporting PTI’s candidate in the by-polls.

PPP’s Saeed Ghani making full efforts to win the by-polls so as to foil the perception that PPP could only win elections from Malir. Kemari and Lyari. It is last chance for MQM-Pakistan to show its powers. Irfan Marwat is an influence personality of the constituency and its support to PTI will play a vital role in the elections.
The area is not only diverse ethnically but also boasts a wide variety of religious groups. The Christian community makes up more than 23% of the registered votes, with 30,000 residents and the Hindu community has another few thousand voters in the area. Minority votes will also play an important role in the by elections.


Candidates affiliated with different political parties have been winning election from PS-114 but non played his due role to serve the masses after reaching in assemblies. Despite whoever will win the by-election 2017, masses of the constituency amid heaps of garbage, over flowing gutters and dilapidated roads will think what they got?

Known as the staunch supporter of Dalit rights, 71-year-old Kovind would become the country’s second Dalit president, after KR Narayanan, if he gets elected. His election is almost a certainty as the ruling bloc with the support of some regional parties enjoys a majority in the electoral college. Moreover, many parties would be reluctant in opposing a Dalit candidate being elected to the country’s highest office.

Reflecting on NDA’s choice for the coveted post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Kovind will make an exceptional president and continue to be a strong voice for the poor, downtrodden and marginalised. “I am sure Shri Ram Nath Kovind will make an exceptional President & continue to be a strong voice for the poor, downtrodden & marginalised,” PM Modi had tweeted. Heaping more praise on Kovind, the prime minister said his knowledge and understanding of the Constitution will greatly benefit the nation.

Kovind’s selection was announced by BJP President Amit Shah following the party’s parliamentary board, which was attended by Modi and senior party leaders. Shah also sought support from opposition parties and said that the prime minister had spoken to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh.
The Presidential election will be held on July 17 and the counting of votes will begin on July 20. The tenure of incumbent President Pranab Mukherjee’s term will come to an end on July 24.
The Congress, however, refrained from commenting on the issue immediately and said the opposition would take a call on contesting the election after a meeting on June 22. “Congress does not want to comment on this issue as we want to take a unanimous decision with all other opposition parties on the presidential elections. The final call will be taken in a meeting of all opposition parties on June 22,” senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said. Describing the BJP’s attempt to reach out to the opposition as a “formality and a PR exercise”, Azad said the BJP should have built a consensus before announcing the candidate. “But they informed us after announcing this decision so there is no scope for consensus now… we were not expecting this from the ruling party. But it is their will, they are free to take a one-sided unilateral decision,” Azad added.
The ruling TRS in Telangana and the Telugu Desam Party were among the first parties to have welcomed the decision and said they would support NDA’s presidential candidate Kovind. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urged opposition parties to rise above party politics and back the NDA nominee for the post of President. On the other hand, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed his happiness over Kovind’s candidature but stopped short of committing support to the NDA nominee.
BSP leader Mayawati stated that her party would be positive provided the Opposition does not field any Dalit for the top post, while Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Kovind was chosen for the post just because he was the leader of Dalit Morcha of BJP.
Meanwhile, the CPI called upon the Opposition parties to put up their candidate against Kovind as the NDA’s candidate for the post of president is from the ranks of RSS.
Kovind, a lawyer-turned-politician, has been a champion of the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, OBC, minority and women’s rights from his student days. He served as the former president of the BJP Dalit Morcha from 1998 to 2002, besides being the party’s national spokesperson. He was also the chief of the All-India Koli Samaj.
Kovind was elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1994 from Uttar Pradesh and served two successive terms till March 2006. He also played a significant role during the stir by SC/ST employees in 1997 when certain orders issued by the Centre had an adverse impact on them. Subsequently, under the rule of the first NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, these orders were declared null and void following amendments in the Constitution.
As an advocate, Kovind was a pioneer in providing free legal aid to weaker sections, especially the SC/ST women, and poor and needy girls under the aegis of the Free Legal Aid Society in Delhi. He has also represented India in the United Nations and addressed the UN General Assembly in October, 2002.

Amir Fit for Selection, Will Play for Champions Trophy Final",https://abbtakk.tv/en/mohd-amir-fit-for-selection-will-play-for-champions-trophy-final/,"June 16, 2017","Lahore (June 16, 2017): Mohammad Amir is set to play in the Champions Trophy final against India on Sunday after recovering from a back spasm that forced the left-arm quick to sit-out the semi-finals against England.
The fast bowler was seen practising at the Oval ground in London’s Kensington borough on Friday, two days ahead of the highly-anticipated final.
Team administration confirmed that Amir has recovered and will play in the match this weekend when Pakistan will face title-holders and arch-rivals India.
On Wednesday, Pakistan delivered an inspired all-round performance to rout a ragged England team by eight wickets in a one-sided in the semi-final.
Pakistan bowled and fielded tightly to restrict the hosts to a paltry total of 211 all out and the lowest-ranked team in the tournament knocked off the runs in style with a massive 12.5 overs to spare.
Amir’s likely availability could leave Pakistan with a conundrum, albeit a happy one. Despite bowling well, Amir was wicketless in the first two league matches, against India and South Africa. He had success against Sri Lanka, taking 2 for 53 and scoring a valuable 28 not out in an eighth-wicket partnership that sealed a semi-final place for Pakistan.
In the semi-final, Amir was replaced by Rumman Raees, another left-arm fast bowler who made his ODI debut in the match; he shared the new ball with Junaid Khan and took 2 for 44 in Pakistan’s eight-wicket victory.
Along with Hasan Ali, who has emerged as Pakistan’s bowler of the tournament, Raees and Junaid surprised England, dismissing one of the best batting units over the last two years for 211. Hasan, who suffered a calf niggle in the semi-final, did not train with the team on Friday but the authorities said that said the bowler was resting as a precaution.

Addressing to a Iftar Dinner gathering hosted by provincial party president Hamyun Khan in Peshawar, Bilawal said that PPP will make solo flight and no alliance will be formed with any party.
Commenting over the country’s political and security situation, he said that there was no direction witnesses by the rulers and the country’s policies as present rulers even did not have the skills to resolve the challenges being faced by the country.
“It is embarrassing when PM was appeared before the 18 and 19 grade officers,” Bilawal said adding that PM was not in politics in 1972 and why he had faced cases.
Lashing out at Imran Khan, PPP Chairman said , “Imran sings song of change in KP and claimed police is servant of people but he is telling lies. There is no difference between Imran and Nawaz Sharif as both are supporter of Kalabagh Dam and privatization.”He said country was facing intense load shedding while KP was deprived off electricity and Sindh was not given its due share in gas royalty.
He that Nawaz Sharif has staged a new drama every day and likened the premier to a “monarch against whom no one could dare speak”.
“It matters not even if Nawaz Sharif denigrates institutions on a daily basis. He had the Supreme Court attacked, but did not appear before it. Yet he stood before Grade 20 officers in the (Panama case) joint investigation team” the PPP chairman said, while addressing party workers in Peshawar.Bilawal alleged that “Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan both are made by the establishment, and have the same mindset”.
Regretting prevailing outages in Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said if people protest against it then the government labels them as pilferers. “Mian Sahib! It’s not the people who are thieves; it’s you and your theft has been identified.
“You were not held accountable in 1972, but it is going to be held now,” the PPP chairman added.
He further lamented that provinces were not being given their share under the NFC award.
Commenting on situation in KP, Bilawal said the people here bore the brunt (of terrorism) and rendered numerous sacrifices.
Criticising the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led provincial administration, he said the (KP government) and Imran Khan have been boasting of social justice and a ‘change’ in the province, but that is only limited to Twitter.
The PPP chairman said Imran Khan’s claims were propaganda, similar to Premier Sharif’s boasts of development.

“The team must not feel threatened or worried by the threats being hurled at them as they have the support of the masses,” Imran told reporters at his house in Bani Gala, Islamabad on Friday afternoon.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, after his maiden appearance before the JIT, cautioned if the people’s mandate is not respected and conspirators continue to further their ‘specific agendas’, “then not only democracy but the country’s security will be at stake”.
According to the premier, he had been held accountable for every single penny, saying a milestone had been achieved that day as for the sake of law and supremacy of the Constitution his family and he presented themselves for accountability, once again.“This mandate is not given to you for corruption and money laundering,” Imran said. “Does being elected representatives grant you a license to loot and plunder the masses.”
Despite PML-N claims, PM Nawaz didn’t appear before JIT as ‘ordinary citizen’
“PML-N leaders, through their statements, are also hinting at not accepting the verdict,” Imran said. “We will make you accept the JIT’s decision; the masses will and your supporters, if taken to streets, will be numbered in front of a sea of people supporting the judiciary.”
“The Supreme Court, its chief justice, and the JIT enjoy complete support of the masses,” Imran added. “The nation is longing for justice against the thieves which would happen for the first time in the country.”The PTI chairman went on to add the PML-N had been trying to make the JIT controversial as they could not buy their loyalties. “The Sharifs are used to bribing people but were unable to bribe the investigating team.”
Referring to the premier’s statement of a larger JIT in 2018 or general elections, Imran asked if being elected grants one the license to be involved in corruption.
This nation is in debt because of the ongoing corruption and money laundering, he said, adding that the Qatari prince’s letter was a fraud. “The PM did not produce that letter for eight months and suddenly brought it out after his address at the Parliament.”
Imran Khan claimed that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had lied over the Qatari prince’s letter to the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) and National Assembly (NA).
“Had the Qatari letter been true there would have been at least a banking transaction. When Nawaz Sharif addressed the assembly, there was no mention of the Qatari prince – but the name was suddenly mentioned in the Supreme Court,” said the PTI chief while addressing a press conference to announce the inclusion of former PPP leader Imtiaz Safdar Warraich.
Imran claimed that the prime minister had started from a single factory and later expanded to 30 factories while remaining in power.
“This is corruption,” said the PTI chairman.
“Nawaz Sharif is accused of corruption, money laundering, concealment of assets and tax evasion.”
The PTI chairman reiterated his earlier demand from the premier and said Nawaz must disclose his source of income from which he bought the London flats.“The ruling party is making the JIT controversial as they have failed to manage and bribe it,” said Imran.
Khan also said that in case the government would not follow the Supreme Court`s decision in true letter and spirit, he will bring the masses on the streets.
“The Pakistani nation stands with the Supreme Court and the JIT.”
The PTI Chairman again reiterated that the Supreme Court should order the prime minister’s resignation until the conclusion of the JIT probe.
Earlier PPP stalwart Imtiaz Safdar Warraich announced to leave old association with PPP and join Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).

Warraich’s switch to the PTI is the fourth major blow to the PPP’s Gujranwala division, home of the party’s central Punjab president Qamar Zaman Kaira.
Recently, former federal ministers Firdous Ashiq Awan, Nazar Muhammad Gondal, Sumsan Bukhari, former Punjab senior minister Raja Riaz Ahmed and other have jumped on PTI’s bandwagon.

There are reports that many other PPP leaders especially from Punjab are in talks with PTI leadership for joining the party.
The bleak future prospect and disorganization of the party especial in Punjab, most populous province which played crucial role in government formation, is said to be compelling even some diehard Jiyalas to desert the party.
Profile of Imtiaz Safdar Warraich?
Born and brought up in northeastern Punjab’s Gujranwala district, Imtiaz Safdar Warraich was among the PPP’s senior members and is regarded as a veteran politician and a party stalwart.
A lawyer by profession, Warraich served as the Gujranwala District Bar Association’s general secretary over 1982-1983 and was a member of the local district council from 1983-1991. He also served as the director of the Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank Limited and was a federal minister in former premier Benazir Bhutto’s second government.He was twice elected as an MNA, in 2002 and 2008, from NA-98, his home constituency in Gujranwala; and as MPA for the Punjab Assembly in 1993, also from a seat in the same region. After his win in 2008, Warraich served as state minister for communication.
He was also PPP’s president of Gujranwala division and appointed to the influential position of president of the party’s central Punjab chapter in 2010. His appointment as the party’s head in central Punjab was a source of disappointment for a group of PPP workers, who said Warraich could not deliver in the province, a traditional stronghold of PML-N.

Lashing out at PM for his media talks after the appearance before JIT Imran Khan said, in a video message, that Nawaz Sharif pointed finger towards judiciary and military for hatching conspiracy against him.
He said the speech delivered by Sharif after his appearance before the JIT was old since it had already been read earlier.
“They have not provided anything new… any evidence to the JIT,” Khan said.
“PM Nawaz Sharif has read out written speech before JIT,” Imran claims.
“When previous Chief Justice and Army Chief retired, Maryam Nawaz had commented that storm has gone,” Imran said in his reaction adding that but Now Nawaz Sharif targeting the present Chief Justice and COAS.
Commenting on Qatar Prince he said he will never come to appear before JIT as he has nothing to inform JIT regarding money trail.
The PTI chairman said the Sharifs’ only defence in the investigation was the letter from Qatari prince Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al-Thani.“Because the Qatari [prince] has refused to appear [before the court]… they have nothing left to explain how money was transferred from here to purchase the palaces in London.”
Khan said it was “most shameful” that the prime minister was portraying the probe as some sort of a “campaign” against his family. He said Sharif had suggested that the army and judiciary were jointly behind this campaign.
Khan said he wants to remind the prime minister that after the new army chief and chief justice took their oaths last year, his daughter Maryam Nawaz had tweeted that the “storm has passed… meaning the conditions were now favourable” for her family.
“This means both the new army chief and chief justice are people who have complete confidence in them [the Sharifs]… today, they [the Sharifs] are pointing fingers at the same people,” said Khan.
The Sharif family has done this for the past 30 years, the PTI chief alleged.
“The umpire is either their own… or against them.”
Earlier, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pleaded innocence after appearing before before the joint investigation team probing into allegations money laundering and corruption against him and his family.
Talking to media after appearing before the JIT outside Federal Judicial Academy, the Prime Minister said that all his assets had already been declared and details were available with Election Commission of Pakistan.

He added that people must be clear that whatever was happening had nothing to do with accountability and corruption. He added that the charges against him and his family were not related to loot of national kitty rather about their family’s personal business.
He added that he had just come out after presenting his stance before the JIT.

The Prime Minister said that his family had faced ruthless accountability in every governments. He added that he was giving accounts of his three generations.
The Prime Minister said that had he or his family been involved in corruption, General Musharraf had not to institute a baseless hijacking case to punish him.
Nawaz said that he and his family’s accountability had been carried out in every regime of PPP.

Pleading innocence, he said that he or his family had never been involved in corrupt practice, saying that he and his family had always come clean in every accountability done by different regimes.
He added”God willing he and his family will come clean in the JIT report and SC’s decision. But there will be another JIT of 20 million people next year and the people will give their decision,” he added.

He added that he appeared before the JIT just because he had respected for rule of law and Constitution.
“Democracy is the name of rule of law and respecting the decision of the masses,” he added.
Earlier, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday appeared before the joint investigation team (JIT) currently seized with investigation into money laundering allegations against him and his family.

The surprise of a result that raises questions about how Britain will advance with its plan to leave the European Union, and whether any party can form a stable government, initially sank the pound by 2pc against both the dollar and euro.

With May’s ability to form a government uncertain for much of the night, the pound steadied in Asian trading before falling sharply again as London traders arrived at their desks around 0530 GMT.
British gilt yields also fell as investors sought the security of government bonds in the face of the uncertainty while spreadbetters predicted London’s main FTSE 100 stock exchange index would fall 1 percent at the opening.
By 0530 GMT, sterling was 1.5pc lower on the day at $1.2753 ─ having fallen as low as $1.2693 ─ and 87.78 pence per euro.
Falls for sterling have tended to support London’s internationally-focused FTSE 100 blue chip index. With trading volumes still extremely thin, official FTSE futures were up around 0.2pc, having earlier fallen by a similar amount.

An up-to-5-percentage-point fall in gilt yields, however, suggested shocked investors would seek the security of bonds when markets reopened properly in London.
Investors’ traditional views of whether the Conservatives or Labour would be good or bad for the pound, have been muddied in this election, not least by the prospect of Brexit talks due to start on June 19.
Some banks have said a high-spending Labour government could spur economic growth and cause the Bank of England to raise interest rates more quickly.
Some also argue that any Labour-led coalition might aim for a softer deal on Britain’s planned departure from the European Union than the “hard Brexit” that markets have worried May would deliver.

Voters have until 10pm tonight to put their all important cross on their ballot papers in stations across the country.
Security around polling stations has been constantly being reviewed and updated in the wake of the terrorist attacks that have hit Britain, a senior police officer has said.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D’Orsi, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for protective security, said “Security around polling stations is constantly being reviewed and updated by local police forces.
“The general threat level remains at severe, so we continue to ask the public to be alert and to report any concerns to police.”
Voting is underway as a new poll reveals that the Conservatives come into the General Election today with a seven-point lead over Labour.

Opinium Research’s final poll before today’s ballot puts the Tories unchanged on 43 per cent with Labour down one point since last week on 36 per cent.
It is the first Opinium study of the campaign which has seen the Tory lead increase rather than shrink and adds to a mixed picture painted by pollsters in recent weeks.
The poll put the Liberal Democrats up two points on 8 per cent, with Ukip and the SNP unchanged on 5 per cent, the Greens on 2 per cent and Plaid Cymru on 1 per cent.

While Opinium offered good news for Theresa May, a Survation poll for Good Morning Britain found the Conservative lead over Labour slashed from 17 points to just one over the course of the last month, with the Tories on 41.5 per cent compared with Labour on 40.4 per cent.
The Liberal Democrats were on 6 per cent and Ukip on 3 per cent.

A daily constituency-by-constituency estimate by pollster YouGov suggests the Conservatives could emerge from the election with 304 Commons seats – down 26 from the end of the previous parliament – compared with Labour’s 266 (up 37), with the Scottish National Party on 46 (down eight) and the Lib Dems on 12 (up three).
This result would deny any party an absolute majority, which requires 323 MPs – assuming Sinn Fein sticks to its policy of not taking up seats.
The YouGov model, which draws on survey data and analysis of key demographics, previous voting behaviour and likely turnout, has consistently shown stronger results for Labour than polls carried out under more conventional methods.

Islamabad (June 06, 2017): Two panels have submitted nomination papers for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf intra-party elections on Tuesday.The PTI’s intra-party elections to elect office-bearers of the party are scheduled for June 11. There are two panel in the run which are Insaf Panel and Ehtisab Panel.

Insaf Panel is led by incumbent chairman Imran Khan while the Ehtisab Panel is headed by an old guard of the party from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Naek Muhammad Khan.


Sources in PTI’s election commission said that nomination papers of Imran-led Insaf Panel was submitted on 14 different seats. They said Ehtisab Panel has also submitted nomination papers with the election commission.
Naek Muhammad Khan is in the run for the slot of Chairman against Imran Khan. Former State Minister Dr Shehzad Waseem of Ehtisab Panel will be facing Jahangir Tarin of Insaf Panel on Secretary General seat.

It is to be mentioned here that Senator Azam Swati was appointed as Election Commissioner for the intra-party election.
The decision to hold intra-party elections was announced by the PTI after the ECP sent written directives to the four provincial election commissions not to allot ‘bat’ as election symbol to the party candidates in any by-election because of its failure to hold intra-party polls.

The PTI had held its last intra-party polls on March 23, 2013 under election commissioner Hamid Khan and, according to its constitution, was supposed to conduct the exercise again by March this year, which it did not.
Mr Khan had dissolved all party organisations in 2015 following complaints of massive rigging in the intra-party elections and in the light of recommendations of a two-member tribunal constituted under retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed to probe the charges of rigging and irregularities in the elections.
The tribunal had confirmed the rigging, recommended action against those responsible for it and even called for removal of some key office-bearers of the party, including secretary general Jahangir Tareen. But instead of implementing the tribunal’s recommendations, Mr Khan dissolved the tribunal. It created a rift between Mr Khan and Mr Wajihuddin, which ultimately led to the ouster of the latter from the party.

Then Mr Khan nominated Tasneem Noorani, a former government official, as election commissioner. But he resigned from the post in last March after developing differences with the PTI chief over the mode of election and other technical issues.

867,Iran to hold 12th Presidential elections today,https://abbtakk.tv/en/iran-to-hold-12th-presidential-elections-tomorrow/,"May 19, 2017","Tehran (May 19, 2017): Iran will hold 12th presidential elections today, while the election is now a two-man race between President Hassan Rouhani and Ebrahim Raisi, the candidate who is closest to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
Past week polling showed Rouhani over the 50 percent threshold, which he needed to win, but also showed that almost 50 percent of voters were either undecided or didn’t express their preferences.
The election results are anything but a foregone conclusion. Those who call these elections window dressing will continue to miss both the intricate politics on display and the underlying issues that inform them.
This is the first election after the death of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in January. Rafsanjani and another former president, Mohammad Khatami, established a moderate coalition — supported by a wide range of political parties — to oppose hard-liners, gradually becoming a diverse power block. This coalition led to Rouhani’s surprising presidential victory in 2013, as well as successful candidates in parliamentary elections.

But some say that Rafsanjani was merely using the reformists in his power struggle with Khamenei. Now, the reformists could improve their relationship with Khamenei directly without having to go through Rafsanjani. In the weeks that followed Rafsanjani’s death, Eshaq Jahangiri — the current vice president who withdrew his candidacy for president Tuesday — met with Khamenei and announced that he would act as the link between the leader and the reformists.
As the leader of the reformists, Khatami also called for a “national reconciliation” to publicly bring together reformists and hard-liners together against the possibility of external threats. Khamenei rejected this idea, and said he saw no need for it. While these are weak signs, Khamenei’s victory over the reformists over the past decade may have given him the confidence to open up some kind of rapprochement in the future.
With rumors surrounding the health of the 78-year-old Khamenei, political actors in Iran have begun to consider his possible successor. Based on the makeup of its executive committee, the current Assembly of Experts — which could choose the next supreme leader — is closely aligned with Khamenei. Khamenei had been a two-term president and a member of the Assembly of Experts when chosen as leader in 1989 — an experience that parallels Rouhani’s.
Khamenei’s death would end his control over an Assembly of Experts that contains many clerics that came to power in 2016 through the Rafsanjani/Khatami-engineered reformist-centrist alliance, enabling a Rouhani run for the leadership position.
For the central command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), it’s important that when there is a change in leadership in Iran, the reformists not gain significant power. A second term for Rouhani poses a threat to them. This explains why the IRGC backed the candidacy of Raisi, the trustee of one of the richest religious sites in the Shiite world who has held important positions in the judiciary and is a member of the Assembly of Experts. Raisi represents the most radical religious parts of Iran and those most loyal to Khamenei.

If he becomes the next president, Raisi will be well positioned to become Khamenei’s successor. In that case, his proximity to the leadership and his position in the assembly may even create a situation like that of Cuba in 2008, where the successor became the face of the country’s leadership even though the leader was still alive and in power.
But the same dynamic applies to Rouhani, who will lose his chance of becoming the next leader if he loses the presidential election, no matter who controls the next administration. However, if he wins by more than 20 million votes, Rouhani will be in a strong position for leadership in a post-Khamenei Iran.
Iran’s unemployment crisis is the single most important campaign issue this election. Rouhani’s opponents use it to criticize his handling of Iran’s post-nuclear agreement economy. While the economic crisis is real — and its roots go further back than the nuclear issue — no candidate, regardless of their political leaning, will be in a position to solve it in a short time span.
In a year of regional turmoil and uncertain relations with the new US administration, the elections on May 19 are of crucial importance both for the future status of the supreme leader and the survival of President Rouhani and the reform movement. The result may prove to be a more serious challenge than the establishment can muster.

868,PPP will not allow RO Elections again: Asif Ali Zardari,https://abbtakk.tv/en/232672-2ppp-will-not-allow-ro-elections-again-asif-ali-zardari/,"May 17, 2017","Peshawar (May 17, 2017): Former president and Pakistan People’s Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari Wednesday said that this time his party will not allow RO elections in the country.
Speaking to newsmen in Peshawar, Zardari said the last general elections in the country were that of returning officers, noting that his party did not campaign for the polls in 2013.
Co-chairman of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), Asif Ali Zardari has asserted on Wednesday to carry out electioneering alongside Chairman of PPP, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan and Punjab while his daughters Asifa Bhutto and Bakhtawar Bhutto would campaign in Sindh for General Elections 2018.

“We will launch a full-fledged election campaign this time. Bilawal and I will campaign in Balochistan, South Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while my sister and Aseefa will campaign in Sindh,” he said.
Promising to not let anyone rig the elections, the former president said that his party fellows will not leave without having received electoral results.
The PPP co-chairman spoke about a range of political affairs at Wednesday’s presser, during his visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He clearly expressed his mistrust in the National Accountability Bureau saying it isn’t a transparent institution, recounting that the Supreme Court labelled Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as ‘The Godfather’.

Zardari said his visit to Peshawar was part of political activities, where workers showered him with love.
He said that he found no signs of ‘Naya Pakistan’ anywhere in the province. “I met government officials here and no one said that he was happy with the current state of affairs.”
“I also met parents of APS martyrs and it made me break into tears,” the ex-president said, adding that investigations into the gruesome incident should again be held.
He said that Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif presented a ‘lollipop’ over Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bill in the parliament and that ‘governor rule’ does not account for democracy.
He said that the PPP leadership waved Pakistani flag in Swat as per promise made by former PM, late Benazir Bhutto. He criticised Government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) by saying that he did not see a ‘new Pakistan’ in the province.
The locals, he claimed were urging PPP to ‘save’ them off PTI’s government. Zardari said that the locals are condemning privatization of hospitals in the province.

While talking about FATA, the former president alleged the premier of making hollow promises to the people of tribal areas.
He censured Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and PTI by saying that lion eventually is a beast who feeds on the weak and tsunami causes damages like it did in KP. Zardari further claimed that federal ministers of PML-N do not have good terms with one another.
In the past four days in Peshawar, Zardari addressed Grand FATA Jirga, visited MNA Ghulam Ahmed Bilour and convened meeting with parents of martyrs of APS attack.

Talking to media after PTI foreign funding case in Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Aziz said that PTI apologized everywhere to everyone. He recalled that when Iftikhar Chaurdy was Chief Justice of Pakistan, the PTI chief went to Supreme Court to tender unconditional apology.

He claimed that even today PTI counsel sought time so that they could tender written apology.
The PML-N leader alleged that PTI had put in place a complete system of foreign funding. He claimed that PTI received funds from not one rather four foreign companies and the amount was used during PTI’s 126-day long sit-in in Islamabad.
Aziz claimed that that the ‘foreign funding’ of PTI was an attempt to create discord and unrest in the country.
It is to be mentioned here that Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday ruled that it has jurisdiction to hear the foreign funding case against Pakistan Tehrek-e-Insaf (PTI).
The ECP rejected PTI’s stance in party’s foreign funding case. PTI had challenged the jurisdiction of ECP, saying that it has no authority and jurisdiction to hear the case.

Upon this, the CEC asked the counsel to submit separate application informing the court as to when the PTI Chief would submit reply in the contempt case.

874,French elections: Tough competition expected between Macron and Le Pen,https://abbtakk.tv/en/french-elections-tough-competition-expected-between-macron-and-le-pen/,"May 7, 2017","PARIS (May 7, 2017): The second phase of the French presidential elections will be held today amid strict security and a tough competition is expected between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen.
Whereas En Marche’s presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron alleged that democracy has been hacked in France just like United States. He said that his campaign’s above 70,000 documents and e-mails have been hacked.
According to the details the document dump happened Friday night, less than 48 hours before the country votes in the final round of the presidential election, which pits the independent centrist Macron against the far-right Marine Le Pen.
The files were released just before 2 p.m. Friday, around four hours before the election campaign period officially closed with its restrictions on campaigning, reporting and polling. These restrictions are aimed at preventing last-minute scandals from emerging and influencing the election’s outcome.
Around 14.5 gigabytes of emails, personal and business documents were posted to the text-sharing site Pastebin through links to more than 70,000 files.
Officials from Macron’s En Marche! party said in a statement that the perpetrators of the hack had mixed fake documents with authentic ones “to create confusion and misinformation.”
French President Francois Hollande vowed to take revenge from the hackers.  While Moscow ruled out any interference in French presidential elections citing that Russia do not interfere in the democratic system of any other country.

875,"French Presidential Election campaign ends, voting on Sunday",https://abbtakk.tv/en/french-presidential-election-campaign-ends-voting-on-sunday/,"May 5, 2017","PARIS (May 5, 2017): Presidential election campaign has ended in France and in the second phase, the voting will be held on Sunday, whereas Emmanuel Macron’s victory has clear chances.
Centrist French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron extended his lead in the polls over his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Friday, the final day of a tumultuous election campaign that has turned the country’s politics upside down.
The election is seen as the most important in France for decades with two diametrically opposed views of Europe and France’s place in the world at stake.
The National Front’s Le Pen would close borders and quit the euro currency, while independent Macron, who has never held elected office, wants closer European cooperation and an open economy. The candidates of France’s two mainstream parties were both eliminated in the first round on April 23.
According to media, Macron will get 62 percent of the votes in the second round compared to 38 percent for Le Pen, an increase of three points for the centrist candidate compared to his projected score in the last Elabe poll.
The showing is Macron’s best in a voting survey by a major polling organisation since nine other candidates were eliminated in the first round on April 23.
The survey was carried out after a rancorous final televised debate between the two contenders on Wednesday, which Macron was seen by French viewers as having won, according to two polls.
Macron’s strong showing in the debate and another poll this week that showed his En Marche! (Onwards!) political movement was likely to emerge as the biggest party in the June legislative elections as well have lifted the mood among investors who had worried about the upheaval a Le Pen victory could cause.
On Thursday, the premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German ones reached its narrowest point in six months, reflecting perceptions that Le Pen had missed her last chance to unseat Macron.
The anti-immigration, anti-EU Le Pen was not giving up. “My goal is to win this presidential election,” she said on RTL radio. “The choices of Mr. Macron are choices which would lead to the end of our country as we know it, the end by being submerged by migration, which he will not oppose given his submission to the policy of Mrs (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel, the choice of the social devastation of deregulation, of ultra-flexibility which will mean war by everybody against everybody else.”
The projected abstention rate would be the second-highest for a presidential election runoff since 1965, underscoring the disillusionment of many voters at the choice they now face.
The turnout for the first round of the election was close to 78 percent, according to the interior ministry.
The poll for Franceinfo radio showed 69 percent of abstaining voters will do so reluctantly, refusing to choose between Macron and Le Pen. Many voted for the more leftist candidates eliminated in the first round.

876,"I would have won elections, if it had been on October 27: Clinton",https://abbtakk.tv/en/i-would-have-won-elections-if-it-had-been-on-october-27-clinton/,"May 2, 2017","NEW YORK (May 03, 2017): Democratic Party’s nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton delivered her most forceful critique of President Donald Trump’s victory on Tuesday, taking personal responsibility for her failed campaign but also pointed to the timing of a letter from FBI Director James Comey and Russian interference as factors.
“If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,” she said in an interview to a US news channel at a Women for Women event in New York.
“I take absolute personal responsibility. I was the candidate, I was the person who was on the ballot. I am very aware of the challenges, the problems, the shortfalls that we had,” Clinton said, before adding that she was “on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.”
Clinton, who is currently writing a book that partly reflects on her 2016 loss, added, “The reason I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.”
The event marks the latest where Clinton, in a stinging rebuke to Trump, both blames herself for the 2016 loss but also casts the current President as someone aided by outside factors, including the Russian government.
Clinton noted that the 3 million more votes she won than Trump. “Fine. Better than the interfering in foreign affairs,” Clinton said. “If he wants to tweet about me than I am happy to be the diversion because we have lot of things to worry about. He should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote than doing some other things that would be important for the country.”
Clinton, aides and friends say, has grown more at peace with her loss in recent months, but is still focused on the interference by the Russian government, especially the fact that WikiLeaks began releasing John Podesta’s hacked emails hours after the damaging “Access Hollywood” Trump tape was released.
Clinton, as she has done in the past, also hung part of her 2016 loss on misogyny. “Yes, I do think it played a role. I think other things did as well,” Clinton said.
But repeatedly, Clinton came back to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s role in the 2016 election and how he was able to tilt the scale in favor of Trump and against her.
Clinton, aides say, sees her role during the Trump years as a political activist who speaks out when issue she cares about are threatened. And on Tuesday, it was clear Clinton was ready to settle into that role.
“I am now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,” Clinton said, drawing cheers from the crowd that included former aides, donors and celebrities like actress Meryl Streep.
The former secretary of state also pledged to “publicly request” that the Trump administration “not end our efforts making women’s rights and opportunities” central to US policy.
Clinton praised Defense Secretary James Mattis for making the case for maintaining US foreign aid funding, despite a budget request by Trump that would cut it.
“I am hoping that because of voices like Jim Mattis and others that that will begin to influence the administration,” she said.
And on North Korea, Clinton cautioned Trump against giving too much away by saying he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un under the right circumstances.
“I don’t believe that we alone are able to really put the pressure on this North Korean regime that needs to be placed,” she said. “Now the North Koreans are always interested … in trying to get Americans to try to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position and we should be very careful about giving that way.”
Clinton said such negotiations could make it harder to work out a solution with countries in the region.
Clinton will also speak on Tuesday at a Planned Parenthood 100-year anniversary gala, where she is expected to slam Trump’s handling of women health issues during his first months in office, including attempts to defund the women’s health organization.
Planned Parenthood has been vocal in their opposition to Trump, slamming many of his appointees and the Republican plan to defund the organization.
Both venues offer Clinton the opportunity to comment on Trump’s first 100 days in office and organizers at Planned Parenthood expect the 45th President will come up in the former Democratic nominee’s speech.
Since spending months out of the limelight after the 2016 campaign, Clinton has re-emerged onto the public stage as the Republican Party grapples with Trump and the Democratic Party searches for a leader.
In a series of speeches, Clinton has shown a willingness to knock the President, as was on display at Tuesday’s interview.
In March, Clinton called the Trump-backed health care bill “disastrous” and knocked the plan for doing away with a maternity care requirement in health care.
“Really? Take away maternity care?” Clinton said during her keynote address at the annual conference hosted by the Professional BusinessWomen of California. “Who do these people talk to?”
And in April, Clinton told another group of women that she is “deeply concerned” with how Russia meddled into the 2016 election.
“A foreign power meddled with our election and did so in a way that we are learning more about every single day,” she said.
She also added that it was “somewhat gratifying” to see Trump mystified about how complex health care is.
“You know, health care is complicated. Right?” Clinton said in a jab at Trump. “That was somewhat gratifying.”
The small group of aides who are still in regular contact with Clinton stress, though, that the recent uptick in Trump criticism does not mean the former secretary of state is on a comeback. Clinton, they say, has remained in touch with an array of groups and while it may appear she is growing more political, the speeches don’t foretell a more forceful jump back into the political fray.
The aides say that Clinton will knock the Trump administration when she sees fit — as evidenced by an April broadside against White House press secretary Sean Spicer after he chided a black female journalist for shaking her head at a news conference.
“Too many women have had a lifetime of practice taking this kind of indignity in stride,” Clinton said.
But they say the former secretary of state is more interested in helping the Democratic Party in 2018 and beyond then resuscitating her own political career.

877,Tillerson calls on Putin in Moscow as Syria rift deepens,https://abbtakk.tv/en/tillerson-calls-on-putin-in-moscow-as-syria-rift-deepens/,"April 12, 2017","MOSCOW: United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday that relations with Moscow are at a low point after meetings in Russia that seemed to do little to bridge a deepening diplomatic divide over a chemical attack in Syria.
Relations are “at a low point, there is a low level of trust between our two countries,” Tillerson said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Tillerson and Lavrov spoke to the press after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in an extended display of US-Russian disagreements over the chemical attack that left more than 80 dead; the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s future; US actions in the Middle East; and Russian involvement in the US election.
The news conference came after Lavrov issued a warning to Tillerson Wednesday against any further US strikes on the Syrian regime. Russia is Syria’s most powerful ally.
The two top diplomats had sat down together earlier in the day to work through the fallout of last week’s chemical attack in northwestern Syria, which plunged the old Cold War enemies to a new low.
Moscow and Washington have traded barbs over last week’s chemical attack, which killed 89 people, and prompted the US to carry out its first strike against the Syrian regime in the six-year conflict, taking out aircraft and infrastructure at a Syrian military air base.
Putin said in an interview with state-run MIR television earlier Wednesday that relations with the US had deteriorated.
“The working level of confidence in Russian-American relations, especially at the military level, under the administration of Donald Trump, has not improved, but rather worsened.”
A White House memo to the press last week mentioned a meeting between Putin and Tillerson had been scheduled, but the Kremlin appeared to have rolled back on the talks as the Syria rift worsened.
Putin has traditionally met with the US Secretary of State on their visits to Moscow. And Tillerson and Putin are no strangers — Putin in 2013 awarded the Order of Friendship to Tillerson when he was CEO of ExxonMobil, the highest honor Russia gives to foreigners.
Lavrov gave Tillerson an icy welcome Wednesday, diving straight into Moscow’s grievances with Washington in what would usually be warm opening remarks.
Russia “saw some very troubling actions regarding the attack on Syria,” he said, according to an official Russian interpreter.
“We believe it is fundamentally important not to let these actions happen again.”
The White House on Tuesday accused Russia and Syria of carrying out a confusion campaign over who was responsible for the chemical attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made comparisons between the US response and its 2003 intervention in Iraq, calling it a “tedious” story.
The deaths have been widely blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but Russia has denied the regime carried out the attack.
Lavrov also complained about the mixed messages coming out of Washington on the Trump administration’s policy on Syria, with the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, making clear Assad should have no future in Syria as Tillerson took a softer line.
“I will be frank that we had a lot of questions regarding a lot of very ambiguous as well as contradictory ideas on a whole plethora of bilateral and international agenda coming from Washington,” Lavrov said.
He hit back at remarks Tillerson made a day earlier that Russia would have to decide whether it was with the US and the West in standing up against Assad, or against them, describing the comments as “wrong choices.”
Tillerson took a more diplomatic tone in his opening remarks, saying that he hoped to clarify “areas of common objectives, areas of common interests, even when our tactical approaches may be different.”
“And to further clarify areas of sharp difference, so we can better understand why these differences exist and what the prospects for narrowing those differences may be.”
It was a hostile start to the long-awaited meeting, which began with the two men entering a conference room making very little eye contact.
The two stood in front of their respective flags beneath a grand chandelier and took their seats on opposite sides of a meters-long table, from which Lavrov delivered his welcome.
The fallout over the chemical attack follows comments by the Trump administration and Russia that a reset in relations between the countries was possible after decades of hostility.

Downing Street said it had told members of Mr Trump’s team that the allegations were “ridiculous” and should be “ignored”, after the claims were repeated by White House press secretary Sean Spicer.
Theresa May’s official spokesman would not confirm whether the administration had offered an apology, but did indicate Mr Spicer had been told not to raise the claims again.
He confirmed that representations had been made by the British ambassador to the US and Ms May’s national security advisor to members of Mr Trump’s team.
The No 10 spokesman said: “We’ve made clear to the administration that these claims are ridiculous and they should be ignored and we’ve received assurances they won’t be repeated.”
He said that the situation would not damage the “special relationship”, and that it was close relations that the US and UK shared that allowed the Government to raise the matter.
Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano alleged during a Fox & Friends broadcast earlier this week that Mr Obama had bypassed the US’s intelligence community and used the UK’s spy centre to obtain details of Mr Trump’s conversations, prompting a rare public and forthright response from GCHQ.
A spokesperson told: “Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct ‘wire tapping’ against the then-President elect are nonsense.
“They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.”
The US Senate Intelligence Committee said earlier on Thursday there were “no indications” Trump Tower was under surveillance by the US government before or after the Presidential election.
President Donald Trump had used a series of Twitter posts to accuse his predecessor, Barack Obama, of wiretapping him.

Obama said: “Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.”
The president said he had warned Mr Putin of serious consequences at a summit in September.
A month later, the US accused Russia of meddling in its democratic process. The president has promised a “proportional” response to the hacking of the Democratic Party and of emails belonging to defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
He appeared to suggest that the US could go on the offensive with its own cyber muscle, stating: “Whatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them.” Mr Obama’s comments came during his last news conference of the year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman has described the US claims as “indecent”
The president did not criticise his successor, Republican Donald Trump, by name, but said some Republicans were failing to acknowledge the seriousness of Russia’s involvement in the US election.
He also expressed bewilderment over GOP supporters who say they approve of Mr Putin, declaring: “Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.”
The president urged Mr Trump to back a bipartisan investigation into Russian cyber intrusions.
Earlier this week, Donald Trump poured scorn on US intelligence claims that Russian hackers helped swing the election in his favour, calling them ridiculous and politically-motivated.
He tweeted: “Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!”
CIA Director John Brennan told employees on 16 December that the FBI agrees with the CIA’s conclusion that Russia’s goal was to help Mr Trump win. The Kremlin denies US claims that Russia hacked official emails, and has called them “indecent”.

888,"Int’l media, think tanks predict Nawaz Sharif’s comeback as PM for fourth term",https://abbtakk.tv/en/intl-media-think-tanks-predict-nawaz-sharifs-comeback-as-pm-for-fourth-term/,"February 8, 2024","KARACHI: International media outlets including BBC, Guardian and AFP have predicted that three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will make a comeback as the country’s elected chief executive for the fourth time in the general elections 2024, The News reported Thursday.
Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted thrice and came back from self-imposed exile last year, will have an opportunity to clear himself from those allegations due to which he lost his premiership in 2017.
Being a prime minister, Nawaz Sharif will have to face volatile supporters of former premier Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated in Adiala jail and has been sentenced to 10 years in jail in cipher case, 14 years in Toshakhna and seven years in an illegal marriage case.
According to The Washington Post, it would be surprising if the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo did not emerge victorious in the February 8 polls.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported: “At a gathering of Pakistan’s business elite in Karachi last week, many people interviewed said they predicted a hung parliament and then a weak coalition government. Most expect it to be led by Sharif — or his brother, Shehbaz, also a former prime minister.”
“If Nawaz returns as prime minister, he’ll face two challenges. One is managing Pakistan’s economic problems, especially soaring inflation and the other is managing his relationship with a strengthened military,” Bloomberg reported citing Madiha Afzal, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution.
CNN reported: “The clear frontrunner in campaigning is Khan’s longtime foe, Nawaz Sharif. The 74-year-old former prime minister is seeking a historic fourth term as leader in what would be a remarkable political comeback following years of self-exile overseas.”
“Veteran Sharif will face a strong challenge, however, from first-time candidate for prime minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 35, son of slain former leader Benazir Bhutto,” added CNN.
“Sharif is a veteran. He’s always been adept at balancing the United States and China very well. He’ll want good relations with India,” said Tim Willasey-Wilsey, a former senior British diplomat and professor at King’s College London. But the likelihood of a PLM-N victory could see an “an abysmally low” election turnout, analysts said.
AP reported, “He has a clear path to a fourth term in office after courts overturned his convictions and prison sentences after his return to the country last October. With his archrival and nemesis Imran Khan now in prison, the stage appears set for a reversal of fortunes from the 2018 election, when Sharif was battling legal cases and Khan became prime minister. With Khan behind bars, analysts predict another victory for Sharif.”
US think tank Brookings Institute mentioned: “The prediction is that Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N is likely to win power. The huge surprise, and for PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) it would be a miracle, would be if PTI-affiliated independents can pull off a win.”
The US think tank added that PTI had become the largest party and won election in 2018 in an election that had been tilted in favour of Khan and against Nawaz. The tables had turned that time around. So, that was an election which was tilted against Khan and in favour of the PML-N supremo.
US think tank, Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Instead, the way has been cleared for Nawaz Sharif, the ultimate survivor of Pakistani politics, to become prime minister and for his party to gain control of parliament with the armed forces supporting them. Sharif is a man who is, shall we say, flexible in his policy views and approach toward the military.”
Sputnik reported: “After the elections, the new leader will have to deal with one of the country’s worst economic crises and an escalating terrorism problem. These domestic issues could affect Pakistan’s foreign policy, particularly its relations with its neighbours and international economic partners.”
Telegraph wrote: “Former PM appears to expect coronation rather than close fight as his main rival Imran Khan lies buried under criminal convictions. As Nawaz Sharif ends his run for Thursday’s general election, the long-standing giant of Pakistan’s political landscape appears to be going through the motions.”

The prime minister, in an interview with a newly launched television channel (Aik News) said the candidates were canvassing and all the rumours would fall to rest by the evening of February 8 – the date for general elections in the country.
Regarding the usual complaints of rigging before or after the elections, he said that learning lessons from the past, the parliament needed to address all the flaws regarding the laws, administration, or the Election Commission.
He said the observers would monitor and local and international media would report on the activity, assuring that as per the standards in the region, the elections would by and large be free and fair.
He observed that the political parties were also involved in the poll rigging by making fake ID cards and casting the votes of deceased persons.
He said voting time would be from 9 am to 5 pm on February 8 and everyone should use his constitutional right to vote to ensure a good turnout.
Emphasising the key focus on the improvement of the national economy, he said unfortunately no political party had yet come up with an agenda to boost the country’s economic health.
He said all the electoral claims made by the parties including jobs, shelters, cheap electricity, food security, and others were directly related to a stable economy.
He said the political parties needed to come up with a plan for revenue generation and widen the tax net. Exemplifying a 91% tax-to-GDP ratio in the Scandinavian countries, he said Pakistan’s ratio stood at just 9%, adding that enhanced taxation would also make the government accountable to the masses.
Responding to a question about his foreign visits, he recalled that soon after assuming the office, he attended the UN General Assembly session – “a forum which cannot be ignored” and later interactions in Europe where he had a stopover for plane refuelling.
He also mentioned attending the BRI Forum in China, the ECO Summit, and the COP28 session where he got the opportunity to interact with world leaders and sign bilateral agreements.
He explained that the caretaker government had to play a role to run day-to-day affairs, including foreign policy matters.
About the repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, he said Pakistan had expelled only those with no identity and record and that such individuals would be allowed to return after obtaining valid passports and visas. Discussing social media, he called it a challenge that empowered individuals irrespective of their educational and mental capability and advocated for its regulation like the mainstream media.
He said the criticism of the caretaker government for doing things beyond the mandate was not genuine as all of its actions were legitimate and vetted by the Law Division besides the backing of cabinet’s approval.

896,SC resumes hearing of lifetime disqualification case,https://abbtakk.tv/en/sc-resumes-hearing-of-lifetime-disqualification-case/,"January 5, 2024","Islamabad:the Supreme Court on Friday resumed hearing a set of petitions seeking to determine whether the disqualification period for a lawmaker was for five years or a lifetime.
A seven-member larger bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, is hearing the case.
The proceedings are being broadcast live on the apex court’s website.
As the proceedings commenced today, the bench summoned Advocate Makhdoom Ali Khan, the lawyer of Jahangir Khan Tareen, to come to the rostrum.
The lawyer stated that the Samiullah Baloch case made a “complete disconnect” between Article 62 and Article 63 of the Constitution, which talk about the disqualification of lawmakers.
“It observes that these are two different sets and two different considerations prevail, therefore the language of Article 63 would not be allowed to inform the language of Article 62 of the Constitution,” he contended.
Makhdoom maintained that the SC, in the said case, was not talking about a declaration made under the penal laws of the country.
At one point, Justice Shah pointed out a benefit that could be drawn from the Samiullah case judgment was that the nature of the declaration was obvious while the duration of the disqualification remains unclear.
For his part, Makhdoom said: “[…] I could not find a case for any common law jurisdiction where as a result of civil liability and a decree of a civil court, a citizen is denied the right to exercise, or the protection of a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution for the rest of his life.”
He further put forward questions regarding which court was capable of granting a declaration under the civil laws of the country that a person is honest and truthful. “There is no civil court in this country which can grant that,” he contended, adding that judges usually grant declarations on a legal title or legal character.
Here, Justice Mandokhail asked if a civil court could issue a declaration of disqualification. The lawyer replied in the negative.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah asked: “Can legislation put a timeframe on this declaration? Could that be possible? Could legislation say that this declaration will continue forever, but for the purposes of elections will have a timeframe?”
In his response, Makhdoom said Article 62(1)(f) does not say that this is a declaration of the civil court. He added that the Constitution keeps qualification and disqualification separate.
“Article 62 applies pre-election, post-election or any time?” Justice Mazhad inquired, to which the lawyer replied Article 63 applied at any time while Article 62 applied only at the time of elections.
Here, the CJP interjected that the court had “bummed down in restricting ourselves to reading just a particular provision of the Constitution and we seem to have forgotten the Constitution as a whole”.
“What is the Constitution all about? What does it do? What are the fundamental rights?” the top judge asked, lamenting that the constitutional history of Pakistan was being disregarded.
“We are disregarding the fact why these amendments were brought into the Constitution, we are disregarding the fact that original Constitution has a greater sanctity than amendments brought unless there are such amendments which enable to serve the people better,” Justice Isa remarked.
He recalled that there was “successive encroachment” made into the Constitution throughout history. “Disregard how it came into the Constitution, now you are stuck with the language of the Constitution,” the apex court judge said, stressing that he could not forget the history of Pakistan.
“We had given public notice in newspapers but not a single political party came before us that this is a good interpretation of the Constitution,” CJP Isa noted. He highlighted that there must be some logic and reasoning behind lifetime disqualification, saying that a person who “destroyed Pakistan” was allowed to contest elections but others were disqualified for life just for some errors in the nomination papers.
“Have we lost all logic and sensibilities?” the chief justice asked. “Will you concede that parliamentarians in Pakistan are the best in the world? Does any other country have this test for parliamentarians? So if we have this test […] that means this is not even a workable law. This is just words on a piece of paper which I can use for my personal projects.”
For his part, Makhdoom referred to a US SC judgment where it had rejected new qualifications for lawmakers sought by Congress. Coming to lifetime disqualification, he said: “The Parliament in the 18th Amendment did not mention that the declaration will remain forever.”

899,Pakistan rejects judgment announced by Indian SC on status of IIOJK,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-rejects-judgment-announced-by-indian-sc-on-status-of-iiojk/,"December 11, 2023","Islamabad: Pakistan has categorically rejected the judgment announced by the Supreme Court of India on the status of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad on Thursday, Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said the judicial endorsement of India’s unilateral and illegal actions of 5 August 2019 is a travesty of justice, based on distorted historical and legal arguments.
He said India cannot abdicate its international obligations on the pretext of domestic legislations and judicial verdicts. Its plans to annex IIOJK are bound to fail.
The Foreign Minister said the Indian Supreme Court’s verdict fails to recognize the internationally-recognized disputed nature of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. It further fails to cater to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, who have already rejected India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019. The judgment is yet another manifestation of the pliant judiciary under India’s ruling dispensation.
Jalil Abbas Jilani said the restoration of statehood, conduct of State Assembly elections or similar steps cannot serve as a substitute to the grant of the right to self-determination to the Kashmiri people.
He said the judgment cannot distract the international community’s attention from the gross and systematic human rights violations being perpetrated in IIOJK.
The Foreign Minister said India’s unilateral and illegal measures since 5 August 2019 have been aimed at changing the demographic structure and political landscape of the IIOJK, in flagrant violation of international law and the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, especially Resolution 122 of 1957.
They remain a matter of grave concern for Pakistan as their ultimate goal is to convert the Kashmiris into a disempowered community in their own land.
These measures must be rescinded to create an environment for peace and dialogue.
He said Pakistan will continue to extend its full political, diplomatic and moral support to the people of IIOJK for realization of their inalienable right to self-determination.
The Minister said that we will write a letter on the issue to the United Nation (UN) secretary general António Guterres.

903,Israel attacks three hospitals in Gaza multiple causalities feared,https://abbtakk.tv/en/israel-attacks-three-hospitals-in-gaza-multiple-causalities-feard/,"November 10, 2023","Al-Quds: Israel has attacked three hospitals in Gaza, including the enclave’s biggest medical complex, resulting in what appear to be multiple casualties, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave has said.
Israel’s military struck a yard at the al-Shifa Hospital complex, where thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Friday.
“Israel is now undertaking these dangerous steps against the hospitals to put them completely out of commission and subsequently displace the people sheltering in them, as well as the patients and medics,” al-Qudra said to an international media out let..
Gaza’s health ministry has said 18 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals and 40 other health centres were out of service either due to damage from bombardment or lack of fuel.
Palestinian media published video footage on Friday of Al Shifa, that it said showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on a parking lot where displaced Palestinians were sheltered and journalists were observing.
Israel wild aggression continued on Gaza on 41st day as the brutal Israel army has targeted 250 areas in Gaza martyring 241 Palestinians climbing the toll since October 7 to 10, 569 which included 4,324 children, 26,475 others injured.
As many as 70 percent population of Palestinians have become homeless whereas 200.3 million masses water, fuel and food have shut down.
The residents of Gaza are now transitioning from North to South.
Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital, said the strike hit civilians located next to a number of journalists in the yard, wounding four, including two critically.
“This led to a lot of casualties, including critical injuries. It could have been a massacre in this place because of the number of people in this complex,” Abu Salmiya the media.
“Before that, they bombed a building very close to the hospital. And now, there are heavy clashes and heavy bombing next to the hospital.”
Abu Salmiya said that medics and patients were in a state of fear due to near-constant explosions near the facility.
“Not a second goes by without bombing close to the hospital. Many of the hospital’s windows have been broken, and there is fear and anxiety amongst the medics and the patients and the displaced people,” he said.
“This is a war against the hospitals and a war against all the [Palestinian] citizens.”
Video of the apparent aftermath of the attack showed several people screaming and scrambling for cover, and an injured man lying on the pavement in a pool of blood.
Al-Qudra said that two children’s hospitals, Al-Rantisi and Al-Nasr, had also been hit by “direct attacks and bombardments” on Friday.
Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director, said on social media that medical facilities must be protected and that “no area is a free-fire zone”.
The attack on al-Shifa is the latest in a series of reported strikes on or near the Gaza City hospital in recent days.
Evacuations from the Gaza Strip into Egypt for foreign passport holders and Palestinians needing medical treatment have resumed through the Rafah crossing, a western news agency reported on Friday, citing Egyptian security and medical sources.
Departures from Rafah, the only crossing to the besieged enclave that does not border Israel, had been paused on Wednesday for a second time following bombardments on the route within Gaza leading to the border.
In the last 24 hours, at least 19 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli forces bringing the total number killed in the occupied West Bank to 176 since October 7.

Democrats are nearly evenly split on how President Joe Biden is handling the Israel-Hamas conflict, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
The poll found 50 percent of Democrats approve of how Biden has navigated the conflict while 46 percent disapprove, showing a deep divide in the Democratic Party over the war.
The war could complicate Biden’s re-election effort as he tries to balance factions of his party with very different views on the conflict, an american news agency reported .
Israeli bombing hits vicinity of another Gaza hospital: ReportWe are getting reports from our colleagues in Al Jazeera Arabic that the vicinity of Gaza’s Patient’s Friends Hospital has been hit by an Israeli strike.

Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera Arabic early on Friday that six people were killed following the Israeli strike that hit the al-Shifa Hospital complex.
The Palestinian news agency, Wafa, also reported six people killed.
When the White House announced that this humanitarian pause, as it’s calling it, would take place starting on Thursday, even as the White House was announcing this movement, Israeli officials were denying that they had agreed to any such thing.
It took a couple of hours before a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister actually said, ‘Yes, this four-hour pause is going to happen every day’, and that residents would get a three hours’ notice so that they could try to take advantage of that break in the fighting.
Now, whether or not this is successful, that’s certainly something that the Biden-Harris administration is hoping for and they very much would like to see these pauses extended.
Why Latin America’s ‘pink tide’ is taking a stand against IsraelAs Israel’s bombardment of Gaza continues, world leaders have increasingly voiced concern over the rising death toll and human rights violations in the Palestinian enclave.
But in the West, few have been as vocal — or as severe in their criticism — as left-wing leaders in Latin America, many of whom came to power as part of a progressive wave known as the “pink tide”.
Analysts said the criticism sends a powerful signal from Latin America, a region that has largely maintained close, if sometimes tense, ties with Israel.
“It speaks to a Latin America that is not willing to tolerate such obvious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law,” said Mauricio Jaramillo, an international relations expert.

Israeli forces launch pre-dawn raid near occupied East Jerusalem: ReportAt least one person was arrested in the raid, according to the Palestinian news agency, Wafa.
Wafa said the man was “assaulted” by Israeli forces while he was in his vehicle before he was arrested.
Israeli forces also targeted several homes in the town of Hizma, firing tear gas and carrying out searches, the news agency said.
The UN humanitarian affairs office also said in its latest report that two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza in the 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.
The video shows a burst of fire as several men, who appear to be rescue workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent, took cover from a series of explosions.

Protesters accuse The New York Times of bias in Gaza coverageDemonstrators occupied the lobby of The New York Times office in New York, accusing the US media organisation of betraying a bias towards Israel in its coverage of the war in Gaza, the Associated Press reports.
Hundreds of protesters, led by a group of media workers calling themselves “Writers Bloc”, gathered outside the publication’s Manhattan headquarters, with many of them entering the building’s lobby for a sit-in and vigil that lasted more than an hour.
Videos on social media show the protesters covering the floor of the lobby with a self-produced newspaper, titled The New York Crimes, bearing the names of the thousands of people killed in Gaza. The protests read aloud the names of those killed, starting with the youngest first, according to videos shared on social media.
Omar Shakir, HRW’s Israel and Palestine director, was commenting on the strike on the al-Shifa Hospital complex’s yard.
“[Thousands] of civilians there. Hospitals must always be protected. No area is a free-fire zone,” Shakir wrote on social media.
Earlier, the rights group warned that patients and thousands of Palestinian civilians sheltering at the hospital complex faced “grave risks” amid Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza and the Israeli ground offensive.
HRW is urging world leaders to act “to prevent further mass atrocities”, Shakir added.
More than 50,000 people fled areas from the north of Wadi Gaza towards the south through a “corridor” opened by the Israeli military.
Hundreds of thousands remain in the north of the territory, where they are struggling to secure the minimum amounts of water and food to survive.
All municipal water wells shut down again due to the lack of fuel, halting the supply of water for domestic non-drinking uses.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, opened two additional shelters.
UNRWA is now hosting 582,000 displaced Palestinians in 92 facilities south of Wadi Gaza in increasingly overcrowded conditions.

Responding to questions at her weekly news briefing in Islamabad today, Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said the ongoing action envisages repatriation of individuals who have either overstayed their visas or do not have the valid documents to stay.
She said Pakistan is all within parameters of its sovereign domestic laws to take action in this context.
She clarified this operation has nothing to do with 1.4 million Afghan refugees that Pakistan has been hosting since decades with exemplary generosity and hospitality despite its own constrained economic situation.
🔴LIVE: Spokesperson's Weekly Press Briefing 05-10-23 at Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Islamabad https://t.co/uow5964rLv
The spokesperson said Pakistan’s national policy on Afghan refugees remains unchanged and their safe and honorable repatriation is a separate matter on which it continues to engage with Afghanistan to create conducive environment for their safe return.
Refuting media reports that Pakistan has closed transit trade with Afghanistan, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pak-Afghan bilateral trade continues but Pakistan will not accept the misuse of existing trade facilities. She said any measures taken recently or in future will be in accordance with this understanding.
To a question, the spokesperson said Pakistan has very clearly articulated its concerns over the use of Afghan soil for terrorism. He said Islamabad while believing in diplomacy and dialogue continues engagement with Kabul to fight the threat.
To another question about a report published in international media regarding India’s anti Pakistan propaganda, the spokesperson said there is irrefutable evidence of India’s involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan but it continues to blame Pakistan for this on fictitious grounds.
She said as Pakistani team is in India for ICC cricket world cup, it is responsibility of the host country to provide foolproof security and conducive environment to the team.
Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan has a clear stance that sports should not be mingled with politics and the Pakistani team is in India, not for a bilateral series but an international tournament.
Responding to delay in issuance of visas by India to Pakistanis for the World Cup, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan is in contact with Indian authorities and expects it to immediately grant visas to Pakistani journalists and spectators who wish to watch ICC matches in India.
To another question, the Spokesperson said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received the formal communication from the Election Commission to invite international observers for the upcoming general elections. She said we will facilitate the process and invite international observers in accordance with the policy and past practice.
The Foreign office spokesperson said free trade agreement between Pakistan and the Gulf Cooperation Council has been concluded and this is the first such agreement by the Council with any country since 2009.
She said Pakistan looks forward to early ratification and implementation of the agreement, which will enhance Pakistan’s exports to gulf countries and mark a new chapter in its economic relations with the GCC.

In an interview with PTV News in New York, he said government’s reform agenda includes increasing tax net, privatization as well as power sector reforms. He said this has developed confidence in international financial institutions and they are now optimistic about Pakistan’s economic stability.
The Prime Minister said Pakistan and the IMF are on the same page vis à vis grant of subsidies to the underprivileged segments of the society.
To a question regarding aid pledges to Pakistan, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar said pledges of almost ten billion dollars were made in the aftermath of floods in the country. It will be ensured that these are converted into tangible resources to be used for rehabilitation and reconstruction of flood affected areas.
Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar said Pakistan has deep rooted relations with China. He said Pakistan has also diversified its relations with the United States and other western countries. He said the West should know that India which sits in its strategic lap to leverage against China, has trade ties with Beijing as well so it will be very unrealistic expectation from Pakistan to have its relations with one country at the cost of the other.
The Prime Minister categorically stated that Pakistan will develop, design and exhibit its foreign relations in independent spheres.
About the India-Canada rift, the Prime Minister said the objective standing of India’s image has collapsed following the killing of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He condemned that India murdered humanity on Canadian soil by killing an innocent man.
The Prime Minister said Pakistan will raise this issue not for the purpose of propaganda against India but to expose the fascism lying under the shrouds of Hindutva. He said Pakistan wants to make the world realize the pervasiveness of this phenomenon and its ability to engulf the entire region in the flames of hatred and conflict.
The Prime Minister said Pakistan has already discussed the issue with the UN Secretary General and the impacts of Hindutva politics on the whole region including in Balochistan where credible evidence has proved India’s involvement in terror activities.
Regarding the resurgence of TTP and Daesh activities, he expressed satisfaction that Pakistan is a success story as it successfully dismantled the terrorist infrastructure. He said Pakistan is proud of its capable security forces and is in close coordination and open communication with the regional countries to counter this threat.
Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar said the caretaker government’s focus will be extending support to Election Commission to conduct free, fair and transparent elections and make elaborate arrangements for this purpose.
The Prime Minister reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for the oppressed people of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir.

The rating agency has identified key indicators that contributed in the positive development rating for the country which include improvement in easing external financing risks.

Speaking at a ceremony at Sabzazar Sports Complex here, he said he had a long conversation with chief of IMF recently and he assured that the government would meet conditions for the loan and provide the required information about budget.
He said Pakistani nation was vibrant and was capable of meeting all the coming economic challenges in case of any further delay in the IMF programme.

He said despite all the economic difficulties, the federal government raised the salaries of employees by 30 to 35 percent, increased pension by 17 percent and increased minimum wage from Rs 25000 to Rs 32000. The government was aware of the economic difficulties of the poor people, he added.
He said major funds were allocated for the sectors of agriculture and information technology in the federal budget presented by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, adding the budget would provide relief to the common man and create jobs.
The prime minister said he assumed government in April 2022 amid very tough economic conditions. Last year, the government of Imran Niazi broke the agreement with International Monetary Fund and the coalition government had to face the challenge of rising commodity and oil prices in the international market and then it spent huge funds for the relief and rehabilitation of people affected by the devastating funds, he mentioned.
The government had to seek help from friendly countries to overcome economic challenges, he continued.He said the government of Imran Niazi showed negligence and did not buy gas when its prices were very low in the international market during the COVID pandemic.

Imran Niazi did nothing for the people but wasted all his time in waging vendetta against opposition leaders, he added.He said Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Hamza Shehbaz and other leaders of Pakistan Muslim League(N) were put in the jails and opposition was pushed against the wall.
Shehbaz said economic stability was not possible without political stability and vowed to put Pakistan on the path of greater progress and prosperity under the dynamic leadership of Nawaz Sharif.
He said the incidents of May 9 were acts of hostility against the nation, adding the military installations were attacked and Jinnah House was burned down on the instigation of Imran Niazi.
He asserted that law will take its course and all those responsible for the incident of May 9 would be punished so that these crimes could not be repeated again. However, he assured that innocent would be treated fairly and with justice.
The PM said in 2017, as servant of Punjab province he started work on a plan for establishing 14 state of the art sports complexes but the fascist government of Imran Niazi stopped the project after the stolen elections of 2018.

In the four years of the previous government, work on the development projects including projects worth billions of rupees of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) were stopped, he said adding the government led by Nawaz Sharif in its tenure eliminated loadshedding, constructed a network of roads across Pakistan and carried out monumental development projects.

“Support of AJK people were with PPP yesterday, today and will remain in future”, he said.
Faisal Kundi while criticizing Imran Khan said that he who claimed that anyone given a ticket by him in the election will succeed can see how people of AJK supported PPP despite his video address.
“This is a clear message for those who were saying that PPP is only limited to Sindh province that political leaders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Gilgit-Baltistan are also joining PPP in a great number”, he said.
About the newly formed political party, Faisal Kundi said that PPP always welcomed democratic political parties.
The SAPM also said that PPP has always advocated the stance of the people of Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) for their demand of holding a plebiscite.

The party’s official Twitter account posted a screenshot of a private new channel’ report regarding Khan’s statement. It claimed that the report was “fake news”.
“Lifafas (paid journalists) are misleading the people once again! PTI Chairman referred to all past statements of PDM regarding dissolution of assemblies. Absolutely not what is being portrayed by some media persons,” the tweet claimed.
However, the news channel  reported Khan’s statement based on the interview he gave to an other private news channel in which he clearly said that he dissolved the Punjab and KP assemblies on the advice of the former army chief.
“In a meeting with General Bajwa held in the presence of President Dr Arif Alvi, he [Gen Bajwa] said that if you want elections, dissolve your governments,” the former prime minister said in an interview with a private news channel on Sunday.
Gen Bajwa had no ideology, Khan said, adding that the former chief of army staff (COAS) told him lies.
The deposed premier said the Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief told him that Bajwa wanted to bring Shehbaz Sharif into power.
He also revealed that a leader from the Middle East had told him a year earlier that Bajwa was not with him any longer.
The PTI chief has previously claimed that Gen Bajwa’s behaviour changed after he was granted an extension.

“Government has nothing to do with his arrest, nor his arrest has anything to do with the delay in elections as Imran is projecting in the foreign and domestic media,” she told a news outlet.
The minister said Imran Khan was continuously breaking the law instead of cooperating with police which was only implementing court orders. She said corruption cases were registered against Khan and he had to be arrested and brought to court to face the charges.
The minister said the PTI workers were continuously attacking police personnel with petrol bombs. Rubbishing allegations of police highhandedness, Marriyum Aurangzeb said police deployed outside Zaman Park did not carry any weapons.
On the contrary, she said  65 police personnel including the DIG Operations of Islamabad had been injured as a result of PTI workers’ attacks. She said Imran Khan’s arrest warrants were issued by the court and unarmed police were present at Zaman Park to arrest him. She said Imran Khan should act responsibly.
She said when the court summoned Imran Khan, he made an excuse for security threats but at the same time, he was ready to hold political rallies which was a clear manifestation of his duplicity.
“Imran Khan wants a civil war, chaos and anarchy in Pakistan as he is inciting people to violence,” Ms Aurangzeb maintained. The minister said Mr Khan had no right to use his popularity to fuel civil war, violence and anarchy in the country.
“When police come to arrest Imran Khan, he makes women and children a shield to protect him,” she said.
Holding Imran responsible for the current economic situation of Pakistan, Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the formerprime minister brought the country to the brink of default.

917,Imran Playing Dirty Politics Over Dead Bodies To Get Petty Political Gains: Maryam Aurangzaib,https://abbtakk.tv/en/maryam-aurangzaib-holds-responsible-imran-for-disturbing-law-order-situation-in-country/,"March 12, 2023","Islamabad: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb has criticized PTI Chairman Imran Khan for disturbing the law and order situation in the country.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore on Sunday, she said that Imran Khan faked a drama of cipher after losing power last year, which badly damaged our foreign relations adding that now he was asked pardon from the USA.
She said that every single political gimmick of PTI leadership, including allegations of imported government has failed miserably.
She said that Imran Khan handed over the country to the IMF and played with the country’s economy.
Marriyum Aurangzeb said after the failure of deploying all ‘political gimmicks’, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan was now “playing dirty politics over the dead bodies of poor people to get petty political gains”.
She castigated the PTI chief that “how many more lives he would use for gaining political mileage”.
The minister said that “Imran Niazi is hellbent on creating anarchy and lawlessness in the county”. She recalled that when the no-confidence motion was tabled against Imran last year, he allegedly concocted the story of cipher and foreign interference without thinking that this would damage Pakistan’s foreign relations.
Marriyum said now “Imran Niazi is tendering apologies to the United States and giving clarifications over his self-constructed cipher conspiracy”.
She said the PTI chief was not bothered a bit by dragging the country towards anarchy just for his “political vested interest”.
She said the former prime minister was using the said tactics to regain power at any cost. For these reasons, the minister said Imran decided to “play with the cipher” and coerced the Speaker, deputy speaker of the National Assembly and even the president to violate the Constitution under his nefarious political agenda.
She said behind closed doors, Imran offered life lifetime extension to the former army chief, but when his offer was rejected he started “attacking national institutions”.
Marriyum said despite all his efforts, he could not spread anarchy and lawlessness in the country and his alleged desire of the “dismemberment of Pakistan after the fall of his government was not fulfilled”.
“From cipher manipulation, he shifted his propaganda to imported government and foreign conspiracy to gain his nefarious designs,” she maintained. She said that every single political gimmick of the PTI leadership, including allegations of imported government, had failed miserably.
The minister alleged that “Imran Khan handed over the country to the IMF and played with the country’s economy”.
Marriyam Aurangzeb said during the PTI tenure, the practice of horse-trading during the Senate elections was rampant and at the time of no trust vote, an audio leak of Imran surfaced about the purchasing of loyalties of legislators exposing his so-called democratic credentials.
“When Imran’s narrative of foreign conspiracy and the imported regime fell flat, he started his long march during which the firing incident occurred and he started the “politics of dead bodies”. She recalled that a television channel reporter Sadaf Naeem ran after Imran’s container in the discharge of professional responsibilities, but she was not allowed to take the interview of Imran. Rather, unfortunately she met an accident and was crushed under the container but the PML-N leadership never accused Imran of her death, the minister upheld.
The minister alleged that during the PTI’s rule journalists were arrested, and kidnapped and their ribs were broken, and at the international level, Imran earned the name of a “predator of journalists”.
She questioned how many “dead bodies Imran would need for his dirty politics”? The minister said that on Imran’s directions, provincial ministers of KP and Punjab were asked to write letters to sabotage the deal with the IMF. The minister also castigated the PTI chief for plunging the nation into the abyss of inflation and “suspending “the IMF program that he himself had signed and played with the interest of the country.
She said that Imran, the other day shared audio of Maryam Nawaz, trying to give it a spin, but to the contrary, the latter never accused Imran or PTI of Zille Shah’s murder, rather she said it was an accident.
Marriyum said Imran Khan instead of appearing in the courts to be held accountable for his crimes had plastered his leg.
She said that the PTI leadership had used the “mentally challenged person Zille Shah” for its political agenda. She also accused that PTI leader Raja Shakeel’s double cabin vehicle was used for shifting the said deceased body to the hospital, but they escaped from the hospital.
She said that in Maryam Nawaz’s audio leak, the PML(N) chief organizer was just expressing regret and sorrow over the attitude of the PTI workers who left the corpse of Zille Shah in the hospital and escaped.
She said that even in her speech, Maryam did not accuse Imran as she had no intention to create anarchy in the country.
On the contrary, the minister said that Imran wanted to create anarchy and lawlessness in the country as he was not willing to appear in courts and file answers to the cases lodged against him.
She said that today, Imran had given the call of a rally[which now has been postponed], lambasting the latter for avoiding the court summons by giving excuses on medical grounds. “He[Imran] has become a senior citizen suffering from diseases which cannot be named publicly,” she quipped.
She said that Imran used to ridicule his political opponents for their ailments but he was now giving excuses for his personal ailments. She questioned why did not the PTI leadership inform the police and called an ambulance when they saw that Zille Shah was hit by a vehicle.
She asked why the driver of PTI leader Raja Shakeel was given shelter in Zaman Park residence of Imran.
She questioned why PTI leader Dr Yasmeen Rashid did not inform the police about the real matter of the incident and why Imran did a tweet even before post-mortem of the deceased. The minister said that a black double cabin of the PTI leader was traced by 31 safe city cameras in Lahore.
She said that Raja Shakeel was hiding in Zaman Park and Imran summoned the father of Zille Shah at his residence and “offered him money” to accuse the police, but he said it was an accident.
She held that Dr Yasmeen Rashid knew every detail about Zille Shah’s unfortunate death but she did not inform the police who had now traced everything from the CCTV cameras.
She said the PTI leadership was trying to use the dead body of its poor worker as “fodder for its nefarious political agenda and now when truth had come out, Imran has announced agitation”.
She advised him that instead of creating anarchy and lawlessness, Imran should appear before the courts, and tell the truth about “Toshakhana gifts theft”, “misuse of charity money and his relationship with Tyrian White”.
She said that thrice elected PM Nawaz Sharif used to appear in the courts in fake cases to set an example for others. His daughter was handcuffed in front of him, but he never sought exemption from personal appearance. Marriyum said that Imran got the entire PML-N leadership arrested including Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz, Khawaja Asif, Saad Rafiq and Rana Sanaullah.
She said that Imran got the “political advantage from the death of PTI worker Zille Shah”. Replying to journalists’ questions, she said Imran Khan was fully aware that he had no answer to the allegations levelled against him. She said Imran who used to accuse political opponents of corruption and money laundering, was himself involved in minting money from the national exchequer.
Taking a jibe at Imran, she said he had the “habit of taking money from others’ pockets”, and when he came to power, he “looted the national exchequer mercilessly”. She said that the government did not believe in political victimization otherwise it would have arrested Imran last year when the PDM government came to power.
She said Imran was facing cases in the courts for which he should be held accountable. She said the PTI was not a political party, rather it was a “gang of political conspirators”.
She said a person who submitted the reply before the courts that he was sick and could not appear personally, was today ready to lead the political rally.
To a question, she said that all citizens should be treated equally by the law of the land. She said that Section 144 was imposed for that person who was absconding from the courts on the pretext of health issues but was ready to lead the agitation.
“Section 144 was imposed for the person who threatened the courts, who instigated party workers to break the gates of the courts, who is using women and children as a shield to escape arrest,” she held. The minister further said that if such persons were given an exemption then all accused would start behaving like Imran.
To a question, she said Shehbaz Sharif had a glorious record as the chief minister of the Punjab and as the prime minister, despite IMF conditions, he had given a marvellous Ramazan package in which the poor would be provided free of charge wheat flour.
She said Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister successfully completed the IMF program as the prices of edible items, power and gas tariffs were at record low as compared to Imran Khan’s era. She reiterated once again that Imran signed an agreement with the IMF and he himself “suspended it”.

The first information report (FIR) was registered on the complaint of Sub-inspector Waseem in the Race Course Police Station of Lahore.
The FIR stated that PTI Vice Chairman Qureshi and Senior Vice President Fawad conducted a press conference at Zaman Park in Lahore with unidentified party workers in which they provoked people of carrying out violence.
Due to that presser, the canal road was blocked and people faced difficulties while commuting, said the FIR adding that Fawad conducted a provocative and infuriating speech. He also spread agitation among people against the state institutions, it added.
FIR also mentioned Fawad accused state institutions of hatching an assassination plot against Imran Khan. It also mentioned that the PTI leader perpetrated a crime by disrupting the traffic on the road.
The charges in the FIR include roadblocks, intimidation, and agitative speeches, among other charges.
Gathering of PTI workers at Zaman ParkA district and sessions court of Islamabad had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for the PTI chief on February 28 in the Toshakhana case registered against him.
To implement the court orders a team of Islamabad police had arrived at Khan’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on Sunday.
After the news regarding the arrest of the PTI chairman reached the PTI, a large number of party workers gathered at Zaman Park on Fawad’s call.
Fawad took to Twitter and stated that “any attempt to arrest Imran Khan will seriously worsen the situation, I want to warn this incompetent and anti-Pakistan government not to push Pakistan into further crisis and act sensibly”.
“The government wants to disrupt the law and order situation in the country. It was the riots to erupt so that the elections could be suspended. It is an attempt to prevent the implementation of the order issued by the Supreme Court regarding the elections,” he said.
Fawad also alleged that the government is insisting Khan appear before the court in a bid to kill him. “Both federal and Punjab governments are different sides of the same coin,” he added.
The PTI leader had called the workers to start preparing for protest in case the chairman is arrested.
“If anything happens, we give a call for peaceful nationwide protests,” he added.
Meanwhile, Qureshi had also said that they will consult with their lawyers regarding the notice sent to Khan and then announce the next strategy.
Qureshi had also said that the party chief has always respected the law and courts and even appeared before the court without security.
“Even doctors did not permit Imran yet he appeared. We will follow the legal process but we need to be cautious,” he said while speaking to journalists.

On the other hand , an 18-year-old man was pulled from the rubble of a building in southern Turkey, the third rescue on Tuesday and some 198 hours after a devastating earthquake as aid workers shifted focus to those across Turkey and Syria left homeless in the bitter cold.
Muhammed Cafer, whose rescue was reported by broadcaster CNN Turk, could be seen moving his fingers as he was carried away, after surviving the huge February 6 earthquake and major aftershock hours later.
A little earlier, rescuers pulled two brothers alive from the ruins of an apartment block in Turkey’s Kahramanmaras province, who Anadolu news agency named as 17-year-old Muhammed Enes Yeninar and his brother, 21-year-old Baki Yeninar. They were taken to the hospital although their condition was unclear.
Rescuers again worked through the night to rescue people clinging to life. But some teams have started scaling back operations as low temperatures reduced the already slim chances of survival. Some Polish rescuers, among many multinational teams that flew in, announcing they would leave on Wednesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, a boy and a man were saved in hard-hit Kahramanmaras, while rescuers were still trying to reach a grandmother, mother and daughter from one family who appeared to have survived in the broken masonry of a building.
In the shattered Syrian city of Aleppo, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Monday that the rescue phase was “coming to a close”, with the focus turning to shelter, food and schooling.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed to allow more UN aid to enter from Turkey, diplomats said late on Monday, helping those in devastated northwest Syria, a region that has received little aid so far.
In the southern Turkish city of Antakya, excavators began tearing down heavily damaged buildings and clearing rubble in one devastated residential area. Blue lights from ambulances lit dim streets where there was still no power.
The Turkish toll was 31,643 killed, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said on Monday.
The total death toll in Syria, a nation ravaged by more than a decade of civil war, has reached 5,714, including those who died in both the rebel enclave and government-held areas.
Turkey faces a bill of as much as $84 billion, a business group said. Turkey’s Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum said some 42,000 buildings had either collapsed, were in urgent need of demolition, or severely damaged across 10 cities.
Dozens of residents and first responders voiced bewilderment at a lack of water, food, medicine, body bags and cranes in the disaster zone in the first days after the quake, with many criticising what they said was a slow and centralised response by Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).
“People are not dead because of the earthquake, they are dead because of precautions that weren’t taken earlier,” said Said Qudsi who had travelled to Kahramanmaras from Istanbul and buried his uncle, aunt and their two sons, while their two daughters were still missing.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who faces an election scheduled for June that is expected to be the toughest of his two decades in power, acknowledged problems in the initial response but said the situation was now under control.
The earthquake has fanned resentment among some Turks towards the millions of Syrian refugees who have fled their civil war to Turkey. Syrians said they had been accused of looting, kicked out of camps and insulted.
The death toll from last week’s deadly earthquake in Turkiye and Syria has risen to 37,000.
According to officials, at least 31,643 people were killed in Turkiye and more than 5,800 in Syria.
Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has agreed to let the United Nations deliver aid to affected parts of Syria through two more border crossings from Turkiye.

Addressing the PML-N workers’ convention in Islamabad, Maryam said: “Your [Khan] selection committee has been dissolved, and the selectors have left for home.”
Her remarks came after accounts attributed to former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa were published in a column of a local newspaper.
“We kept trying to convince the prime minister [Imran Khan] against appointing Tarin as finance minister. I told the PM that Tarin, who failed to run his bank, will ruin the economy. The premier disagreed,” Gen (retd) Bajwa was quoted as saying by the journalist.
Reacting to the ex-army chief’s interview, Khan said that Gen (retd) Bajwa had accepted that he was behind the “regime change” move that led to his government’s removal.
“General Bajwa told the journalist with much pride how he had our government ousted due to economic policies and other matters,” Khan said during the interview.
The PML-N leader vowed that the Bhara Kahu flyover would be completed soon. She urged the people to compare the governance of PML-N and PTI during the past 10 years in Punjab and KP, respectively.
“Nawaz Sharif is called [back] whenever the country falls by the hands of the incompetent,” the PML-N leader added.
Maryam lashed out at the previous government of PTI and said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar should have made the person, who has restricted himself to Zaman Park, sit before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for talks.

He said Nawaz Sharif was the man who ‘challenged’ the status and later he was ‘deceived’ by some of the party leaders. He vowed to expose the team which ‘deceived’ the former prime minister.
Replying to a question, Maryam Nawaz’s husband said the parliamentarians should not change their loyalties. It is not right to win elections on PTI’s tickets and later change your loyalties for power, he maintained.
Safdar was of the view that elections in Punjab and KP should be delayed and went on to say to hold general elections in 2025 after the recovery of the economy.
The PML-N leader regretted his personal attacks on Imran Khan and political rivalry should remain political, not personal.
We all have shortcomings in our life, that should not be exploited in a political rivalry, he added.

Erdogan, who contests an election in May, said on a visit to the disaster zone that operations were now working normally and promised no one would be left homeless, as the combined reported death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria rose past 12,000.
But across a swathe of southern Turkey, people sought temporary shelter and food in freezing winter weather, and waited in anguish by piles of rubble where family and friends may lie buried. Rescuers were still digging out some people alive. Others were found dead.
There were similar scenes and complaints in neighbouring Syria, where the impact of Monday’s huge quake extended to.
The death toll from both countries was expected to increase as hundreds of collapsed buildings in many cities have become tombs for people who had been asleep in their homes when the quake hit in the early morning.
In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens of bodies, some covered in blankets and sheets and others in body bags, were lined up on the ground outside a hospital.
Families in southern Turkey and in Syria spent a second night in the freezing cold.
Many in the disaster zone had slept in their cars or in the streets under blankets, fearful of going back into buildings shaken by the 7.8 magnitude tremor — Turkey’s deadliest since 1999 — and by a second powerful quake hours later.
“Where are the tents, where are food trucks?” said Melek, 64, in Antakya, saying she had not seen any rescue teams. “We survived the earthquake, but we will die here due to hunger or cold here.”
The confirmed death toll rose to 9,057 in Turkey on Wednesday, and in Syria had climbed to at least 2,950, according to the government and a rescue service operating in the rebel-held northwest.
Turkish authorities released video of rescued survivors, including a young girl in pyjamas, and an older man covered in dust, an unlit cigarette clamped between his fingers as he was pulled from the debris.
In Syria’s Aleppo, staff at the Al-Razi hospital attended to a man with bruised eyes who said more than a dozen relatives including his father and mother were killed when the building they were in collapsed.
“We were 16 and 13 of us died. My brother, one-and-a-half-year-old niece and I got out. Thank God,” he said.
“My father, my mother, my brother, his wife and their four children. The wife and two kids of my brother who got out with me also died.”TVErdogan, who has declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces and sent in troops to help, arrived in Kahramanmaras to view the damage and see the rescue and relief effort.
Speaking to reporters, with the wail of ambulance sirens in the background, Erdogan said there had been problems with roads and airports but “we are better today”.
“We will be better tomorrow and later. We still have some issues with fuel … but we will overcome those too,” he said.
However, the disaster poses a challenge to him in the May election that was already set to be the toughest fight of his two decades in power.
Any perception that the government is failing to address the disaster properly could hurt his prospects. On the other hand, analysts say, he could rally national support around the crisis response and strengthen his position.The quake toppled thousands of buildings including hospitals, schools and apartment blocks, injured tens of thousands, and left countless people homeless.
Entire streets in Kahramanmaras, near the epicentre, were reduced to rubble, drone footage showed, with plumes of smoke rising from fires across the town. Hundreds of tents were set up as shelters in a sporting venue.
A journalists belonged to western news agency  saw around 50 bodies draped in blankets on the floor of a sports hall.
Turkish authorities say some 13.5 million people were affected in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east. In Syria, it killed people as far south as Hama, 250 km from the epicentre.
‘Under the rubble’In Syria, the relief effort is complicated by a conflict that has partitioned the nation.
Residents in Syrian government-held territory have described the authorities’ response as slow, with some areas receiving more help than others. State news agency SANA quoted Hussein Makhlouf, minister of local administration and environment, as saying the state had opened 180 shelters for displaced people.
In Jandaris in northern Syria, rescue workers and residents said dozens of buildings had collapsed.
Standing around the wreckage of what had been a 32-apartment building, relatives of people who had lived there said they had seen no one removed alive. A lack of heavy equipment to lift large concrete slabs was impeding rescue efforts.
Rescue workers have struggled to reach some of the worst-hit areas, held back by destroyed roads, poor weather and a lack of heavy equipment. Some areas are without fuel and electricity.
A rescue service operating in insurgent-held northwest Syria said the number of dead had climbed to more than 1,280 and more than 2,600 were injured. The Syrian health minister said the number of dead in government-held areas rose to 1,250.
Across the street from an Aleppo apartment building reduced to rubble, 25-year-old Youssef has waited for two days for news of his father, mother, brother, sister and her son.
He said he had heard their voices, and spoken to them, but poorly equipped rescue workers had not been able to reach them.
“I talked to them and heard their voice, but unfortunately as you can see here they’re very slow at work and they don’t have enough equipment,” he said.

Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
“This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term – because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that,” Ardern, 42, told a news conference.
“I know there will be much discussion in the aftermath of this decision as to what the so called ‘real’ reason was… The only interesting angle you will find is that after going on six years of some big challenges, that I am human,” she continued.
“Politicians are human. We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.”
A ruling New Zealand Labour Party vote for a new leader will take place on Sunday; the party leader will be prime minister until the next general election. Ardern’s term as leader will conclude no later than Feb. 7 and a general election will be held on Oct. 14.
Ardern said she believed Labour would win the upcoming election.

Talking to a private news channel on Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict regarding Local Govt Polls tomorrow, Saturday, he said “We respect the court, but holding the elections is not possible as the arrangements cannot be made in such a short period,”.
Rana Sanaullah said that as many as 1,000 polling stations needed security, election material is still not deployed at the stations and the polling staff will also be needed. “This isn’t possible.”
The  (IHC) had earlier directed the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold local government elections in the capital on December 31 after it accepted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-e-Islami’s (JI) petitions seeking to nullify ECP’s decision to postpone the local polls.
“The federal government is directed to provide all the assistance to the Election Commission of Pakistan for conducting the local bodies’ elections as mandated by the Constitution,” Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir said in a one-page short order.
The minister also added that since the “ground realities” do not permit the government to ensure the polls take place, the centre was going to file an intra-court appeal against the order.
“The order was issued in the evening after office hours. How is it possible to make the arrangements for the [elections]? What can be a more strong reason than this,” Sanaullah said when asked about what his hopes were about the petition’s acceptance.
The minister said he was not surprised by the order, but noted that directions should be “implementable” and the latest IHC order will ensure “that the elections do not take place”.
Sanaullah said a new schedule should be issued for the polls, and there is no other way to hold the elections as he ruled out assisting the election commission.
“It isn’t possible [to assist] the commission. We cannot provide security in such a short time period for 1,000 polling stations. Islamabad Police are not enough as will need to deploy Rangers and FC will have to be called in,” he added.

930,‘Political Terrorist’ Imran Symbol Of Country’s Degradation: Marriyum,https://abbtakk.tv/en/political-terrorist-imran-symbol-of-countrys-degradation-marriyum/,"December 11, 2022","Rawalpindi: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb, while terming PTI chairman Imran Khan ‘a political terrorist’ said he was a symbol of the country’s degradation.
Addressing the Muslim League-Nawaz workers’ convention here, the minister said all the allegations levelled by the ‘Toshakhana thief’ against the PML-N leadership proved wrong.
She said it was ironic that a person, who did not start a single development project when in power, was blaming those who brought investments worth billions of rupees to the country.
The minister said the Daily Mail’s apology to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was actually an apology to the 220 million people of Pakistan. Imran Khan, in animosity of Shehbaz Sharif, used David Rose to publish a baseless news story against the PM, she added.
She said that in 2016 when Nawaz Sharif was holding office, Pakistan’s GDP growth rate was 6.2 percent whereas inflation was only 2.3 percent. During Nawaz’s era, she added, the IMF programme was rolled back, CPEC projects were started, employment opportunities were provided to the youth, and 14,000 megawatts of electricity were added to the national grid.
The minister said at that time, a conspirator, incompetent, inefficient and ‘Toshkhana thief’ was waiting for the finger of the umpire and holding sit-ins.
She said Nawaz Sharif made the country a nuclear power but Imran Khan ruined the development process.
Marriyum said Nawaz Sharif, in his tenure, eradicated the scourge of terrorism, but when Imran Khan came to power, terrorism rose its head again.
She said ‘the Toshakhana thief’ alleged that the PML-N leadership was involved in money laundering, but he could not give any evidence in the courts of Pakistan and the United Kingdom. On the contrary, he himself was caught doing money laundering. Marriyum Aurangzeb asked when will Imran Khan give an account of his theft?
Imran Khan made the country’s treasury a “retail shop” during his time, whereas Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was striving for the betterment of the people.
She congratulated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal for emerging victorious in the court cases.
She said Hanif Abbasi was sentenced to 25-years imprisonment in Imran’s tenure but he stood firm and even now standing firm like a lion. Imran took false oaths and put a heroin case on Rana Sanaullah, who stood strong like a rock and still standing like a lion with Nawaz Sharif.
She said Imran embezzled the BRT money and abused the Chief Election Commissioner when it decided the case against him on merit.
He used to offer an extension to the army chief in closed rooms but campaigned against the martyrs outside.
Imran Khan, she said, appointed an incompetent and inefficient person as the chief minister of Punjab who damaged the province.
Taking a jibe at the PTI chairman, she said, after 4 years in power, Imran claimed that he had no power, whereas he had Farah Gogi and Pinki with him. She said Imran Khan even sold a gifted watch carrying the image of the Holy Kaaba.
She said, in Imran Khan’s era, Nawaz Sharif used to come to courts along with his daughter and presented documents from the past 40 years in accountability courts to clear his name.
She said when Imran Khan was asked to answer for his wrongdoings, he got worried and appeared in public on the wheelchair.
During the address, the slogans in favour of the PML-N leadership were raised by the party workers, who came in large numbers to attend the rally.

Addressing a live media talk here, the Defence Minister said his news conference intended to narrate the facts before the nation to provide the background for the recent scandal of Imran Khan.
Khawaja said Imran Khan did huge mudslinging and vandalization of his political rivals during his tenure. He added that a letter pertaining to £190 million was presented in Khan’s cabinet that he secretly gave to Malik Riaz’s Bahria Foundation. “This is not new as Imran Khan’s dishonesty continued to reveal after his ouster from power. He orchestrated hoax narrative of foreign conspiracy and backed out from his own statements.”
The way Khan perpetrated false narrative and sold the precious gifts received from the dignitaries of a friendly country had damaged the honour and integrity of the county, he added.
“We are not in a sound state internally due to our weak economy and owing to which it has reflection on our external relations as well”, he added.
The Defence Minister alleged that Imran Khan wanted Pakistan to go default and targeted army and its top official for satiating his personal whims. On one hand, he said Khan was following his so-called style of intimidation and on the other he was pleading behind the doors to the Army Chief for his help during his meeting arranged by the President.
He accused that Khan had done financial misappropriation and was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan which was all matter of record.
He pointed out that previous day scandal of selling toshakhana watches had two important things as the dates were manipulated on which the wrist watches were sold in the market. The law was also manipulated to buy the toshakhana gifts on 20% value.
The gift was given by the friendly country’s Crown prince that had a unique prestige, he said, adding, “The dates of money deposited in the record have separate dates which should be probed.”
The Defence Minister underscored that the individuals involved in the sale of the gifts should be present in Pakistan and should record their statements during the investigation.
“Imran Khan himself has been disqualified from ECP and he put the burden of resentment on the nation by hurling hoax propaganda.”
Nawaz Sharif was lifetime disqualified for not declaring Rs10,000 and his daughter was also penalized whereas Imran Khan had crossed all ethical limits, he said.
The government, he said was now demanding to hold Imran Khan accountable as per the law that disqualified Nawaz Sharif for hiding Rs10,000.
“We have come to a turn where a clean judicial process not the one that indicted Maryam Nawaz and Nawaz Sharif rather a fare and impartial system should hold Imran Khan accountable.”
The channels of money received by Imran Khan should be probed as Khan was presenting a dubious record of his Ferozewala land having changing status from benamedar to self-owned or inherited property to confirm his income sources, he added.
“There is rule of law in Pakistan now whereas in Imran Khan’s three years rule several political leaders were detained including Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Shehbaz Sharif, Shahid Khaqqan Abbasi, Asif Ali Zardari and his sister among others.”
He added that there was a reign of terror during his tenure as anyone could be detained through National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
The details of all the gifts received by the Prime Minister, the cabinet ministers and including the Defence Minister (himself) were placed in the showcases of the prime minister office where earlier looting and corruption and law violations were rampant during Imran Khan’s rule, he added.

“Imran Khan has played his last card by holding a part time long march, but it turns out to be a flop show as the nation has refused to defend his lies and false narrative of regime change conspiracy,” she said while addressing a news conference.
She said Imran Khan thought that he would succeed in removing the current government by holding a long march, but it did not happen.
The prime objective of long march was to prevent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif from appointing the new Army Chief, she said, adding the appointment would be made by the PM in line with constitution and law.
Maryam Nawaz said the march of Imran Khan had nothing to do with the people’s welfare, but aimed at creating chaos and anarchy in the country.
She regretted the ruthless use of provincial resources in the long march by Imran Khan.
The PML-N leader said that he began the long march after exhausting his all his options. First, he held public gatherings to build false narrative of regime change conspiracy which he thought would help pressurize the government in getting a date for fresh election.
She said Imran Khan resorted to the long march when his first plan got failed and the people came to know about the reality of false narrative of regime change conspiracy.
He thought that he would mislead the people with his lies but he was mistaken as the people had rejected his long march and lies, she added.
She criticized Imran Khan for launching verbal attack on the state institutions for political gains. His criticism of the Chief Election Commissioner was “deplorable”.
Maryam said the CEC had brought forth actual facts about the foreign funding received by Imran Khan. His crime had been exposed before the nation.
She said the false narratives of Imran Khan on different issues had been done and dusted after the recent presser of the Director General of ISI and the Director General ISPR.
The PML-N leader regretted that Imran Khan’s criticism of state institutions was being highlighted in the media which was praising him for his “despicable” acts.
She said more cases of corruption of Imran Khan would surface soon and the nation would know as to how he ruthlessly looted the nation during his four year rule which was marred by corruption, unemployment, extreme inflation and wrong economic policies.
She said that Imran Khan was a power hungry person and had nothing to do with the democratic norms and values.
Maryam said Imran Khan filed fabricated cases of corruption against her and Nawaz Sharif, but failed to produce single evidence in the court.

942,UK Daily Reveals Funding To PTI From Foreign Country,https://abbtakk.tv/en/uk-daily-reveals-pakistani-tycoon-funding-to-pti-from-foreign-country/,"July 29, 2022","London: An expose by the Uk newspaper the Financial Times has blown the lid off Pakistani tycoon Arif Naqvi’s involvement in the party’s finances and how a significant portion of its funding in 2013 was of foreign origin.
The exposing story surfaces at a time when the country awaits the verdict reserved by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) into the PTI’s prohibited funding.
According to the report of the UK Daily “Naqvi transferred three instalments directly to the PTI in 2013 adding up to a total of $2.12m”.
At the centre of the saga is Wootton Cricket Ltd, a Cayman Islands-incorporated company owned by Naqvi, and the money from charity fundraisers, such as the “Wootton T20 Cup”, to bankroll PTI.
Naqvi, the founder of the Dubai-based Abraaj Group, one of the largest private equity firms operating in emerging markets back when the PTI was campaigning for the 2013 elections, hosted the cricket tournament at his country estate in the Oxfordshire village of Wootton from 2010 to 2012, FT said.
The guests were asked to pay between £2,000 and £2,500 each to attend, according to the UK publication. Quoting, Naqvi, it added that that the money went to unspecified “philanthropic causes”.
“Funds poured into Wootton Cricket from companies and individuals, including at least £2m from a United Arab Emirates government minister who is also a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family,” read the FT report.
Political parties in Pakistan are not permitted to receive funding from foreign nationals and companies, but Wootton Cricket account details and emails seen by FT for the period between February 28 and May 30, 2013, reveal that both companies and foreign nationals, as well as Pakistanis, sent millions of dollars to Wootton Cricket after which funds were transferred to the PTI in Pakistan.
The ECP had been probing the party’s funding since 2014, when party founder Akbar S Babar alleged major irregularities in the party’s finances, including in funding from outside Pakistan.ECP has now concluded the case after seven years of trial. The date the verdict will be announced is yet to be revealed.

946,Former Japan Premier Shinzo Abe Shot Dead,https://abbtakk.tv/en/former-japan-premier-shinzo-abe-shot-dead/,"July 8, 2022","Tokyo: Former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving leader, died on Friday after being shot while campaigning for a parliamentary election, an official from his political party said.
A man opened fire on Abe, 67, from behind with an apparently homemade gun as he spoke at a drab traffic island in the western city of Nara, Japanese media showed earlier.
It was the first assassination of a sitting or former Japanese premier since the days of prewar militarism in the 1930s.
Speaking before Abe’s death was announced, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the shooting in the “strongest terms” while Japanese people and world leaders expressed shock at the violence in a country in which political violence is rare and guns are tightly controlled.
“This attack is an act of brutality that happened during the elections — the very foundation of our democracy — and is absolutely unforgivable,” said Kishida, struggling to keep his emotions in check.
A fire department official had said Abe appeared to be in a state of cardiac arrest when airlifted to hospital.
Police said a 41-year-old man suspected of carrying out the shooting had been arrested. NHK quoted the suspect, identified as Tetsuya Yamagami, as telling police he was dissatisfied with Abe and wanted to kill him.
Abe was making a campaign speech outside a train station when two shots rang out at about 11:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). Security officials were then seen tackling a man in a grey T-shirt and beige trousers.
“There was a loud bang and then smoke,” businessman Makoto Ichikawa, who was at the scene said, adding that the gun was the size of a television camera.
“The first shot, no one knew what was going on, but after the second shot, what looked like special police tackled him.”
Earlier, Kyodo news service published a photograph of Abe lying face-up on the street by a guardrail, blood on his white shirt. People were crowded around him, one administering heart massage.
Nara emergency services said he had been wounded on the right side of his neck and left clavicle. His brother, Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi, had said Abe was getting blood transfusions.
NHK showed live footage of Abe’s wife, Akie, on her way by train to the hospital where he was being treated.
Tradition Of Meeting People During Political Campaign
Senior Japanese politicians are accompanied by armed security agents but often get close to the public, especially during political campaigns when they make roadside speeches and shake hands with passersby.
History of Shootings At Politicians
In 2007, the mayor of Nagasaki was shot and killed by a yakuza gangster. The head of the Japan Socialist Party was assassinated during a speech in 1960 by a right-wing youth with a samurai short sword. A few other prominent postwar politicians were attacked but not injured.
Shooter Of Shinzo Abe
Police said the suspected shooter was a resident of Nara. Media said he had served in Japan’s military for three years until 2005. Defence Minister Kishi declined to comment on that.
Shinzo Abe As A Premier of Country
Abe served two terms as prime minister, stepping down in 2020 citing ill health. But he has remained a dominant presence over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), controlling one of its major factions.
Kishida, Abe’s protege, had been hoping to use the election to emerge from Abe’s shadow and define his premiership, analysts have said. Kishida suspended his election campaign after the shooting. All main political parties condemned the attack.
US Secretary Of State Expresses Deep Concerns
Speaking before Abe’s death was announced, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed deep concern over his condition.
“Our thoughts, our prayers are with him, with his family, with the people of Japan,” Blinken said on the sidelines of a G20 meeting on the Indonesian island of Bali.
The United States is Japan’s most important ally.
Abe is best known for his “Abenomics” policy of aggressive monetary easing and fiscal spending.
He also bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military’s ability to project power abroad.
Abe, however, did not achieve his goal of revising the US-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan’s military in known, into the pacifist Article 9.
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.
He became prime minister again in 2012.
Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a grandfather who served as premier.

950,UK PM Johnson  Survived In Confidence Vote,https://abbtakk.tv/en/uk-pm-johnson-survived-in-confidence-vote/,"June 7, 2022","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will seek to shore up his position on Tuesday by setting out a raft of new policies to senior ministers after he survived a confidence vote that revealed the scale of the threat to his position.
Johnson won the vote late on Monday by 211 votes to 148 — enough to avoid having to immediately resign but a larger than anticipated rebellion within his party that leaves him politically wounded and battling to win back the confidence of his colleagues and the general public.
His first challenge will be to convince his most senior allies, some of whom would have likely run to replace him if he had been forced out, that he will be able to move on from questions about his leadership.
Johnson’s office issued a statement saying he would use the meeting to set out his vision for the coming weeks, including new policies to reduce the cost of childcare and to help more people buy their own homes.
“This is a government that delivers on what the people of this country care about most,” Johnson said in the statement.
“We are on the side of hard-working British people, and we are going to get on with the job.”
Lawmakers in Johnson’s party called the confidence vote after months of scandal over lockdown-breaking parties at the heart of government and criticism of his response to an inflation-fuelled surge in the cost of living.
The front pages of British newspapers offered little comfort that the vote was, as Johnson described it in the aftermath on Monday, a decisive result that allows him to refocus on his political priorities.
The Daily Telegraph called the result a “hollow victory. The Sun tabloid declared “PM survives … Just”
Calling the result a “pyrrhic victory”, the Times leader column said the narrow win left Johnson’s political authority badly dented and his party even more divided.
“If Mr Johnson is to avoid leading the Tories (Conservatives) to a calamitous defeat in the next election, he will need to show a degree of grip and focus that has been largely absent so far in his premiership … ,” it said.
The rules of Johnson’s Conservative Party mean he is safe from another confidence vote for the next 12 months, but those rules could technically be changed if there is enough political will to do so.
In 2018, Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May won a larger percentage of a similar confidence vote only to resign six months later.

Addressing news conference, she said: “It is a condemnable statement of Imran Khan that Pakistan, will be divided into three parts,” and questioned on whose agenda he was up to.
Lambasting the statement of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan about strategic assets and disintegration of the country, she said the the country would stay integrated forever that came into being, after great sacrifices by Muslims of the Sub-continent.
Imran Khan seeks vengeance from the Pakistani state for his government's and opposition's failures.@MaryamNSharif pic.twitter.com/5BNP3wL7Vf
She said the statement was tantamount to disgracing the sacrifices rendered by Muslims for an independent state, Pakistan. With the Grace of Allah Almighty no damage could be done to Pakistan as the country was in safe hands.
Not Pakistan, rather it was the PTI which would eventually be disintegrated into three hundred pieces.
She said political parties including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan People’s Party and Pakistan Awami Party did face hardships but they always raised the slogan of “Pakistan Zindabad and Pakistan Khappay”.
Maryam Nawaz said former Prime Minister Imran Khan had lust for power and had now resorted to dirty politics to get in the government again.
The PML-N leader said it was hallmark of mainstream politicians that they always worked for the greater national unity, not for the division.
She also berated Imran Khan for negative remarks about the rollback of strategic programme of the country. She said Imran Khan in a previous interview with foreign media outlet had said that Pakistan did not need the strategic capability.
The PML-N Vice President said Imran Khan had been issuing such statements since his party contributed nothing in making Pakistan a nuclear power.
Maryam Nawaz also criticized Imran Khan for not duly recognizing services of Armed Forces and said security departments were performing their duties in line with the Constitution.
She said the PTI chairman was desperate to regain the powers despite the fact that his mandate in 2018-election was bogus, adding Imran Khan betrayed everyone whosoever reposed confidence in him.
She said the past regime of PTI, under Imran Khan, had ruined the national economy with his sheer incompetence and flawed policies.
She called upon citizens, regardless of political affiliation, to play their due part to steer the country out of the present crisis, and asked students, young generation, opinion makers and analysts to stand with Pakistan.
“You are not required to support PML-N or the government but need to stand with Pakistan,” she added.
The previous PTI government, she said, did nothing for the welfare of the common people, except resorting to political victimization and misuse of official resources for political gains.
She said that Imran Khan was the root cause of all the problems presently the country was faced with.

The court resumed hearing of the contempt case related to the publication of an affidavit in which Rana Shamim accused ex-chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar of denying bail to PML-N leaders.
Justice Athar Minallah has, once again, instructed the former GB judge to present the original copy of the affidavit in court. At the previous hearing, Rana Shamim was told to submit the original document or face charges.
During the proceeding on Monday, senior journalist Ansar Abbasi, a media group editor Amer Ghouri, and Attorney General Khalid Jawed were present.
At the beginning of the hearing, Justice Minallah asked why a newspaper would publish something which could “tarnish the image” of a top judge.
Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) secretary-general Nasir Zaidi, who is the impartial advisor to the court in the case, said that a journalist’s responsibility is to publish a news story on the basis of facts.
Justice Minallah replied that the news story gives an impression that the judge takes directions from other people. “The story should have mentioned that the judge [Saqib Nisar] was on leave during those days.”
“The public’s trust in this court has been damaged by one news [report],” he said.
Justice Minallah also recalled that Rana Shamim had said that the affidavit was never given to anyone. To this, Ansar Abbasi replied that Rana Shamim never told him that the affidavit was not supposed to be published.
The court, consequently, directed the journalist to read the news story and state whatever he wanted to say in a counter-affidavit.
During the proceeding, AGP Khalid Jawed urged the court to set a date for the indictment of Rana Shamim.
“The court had given him [former GB judge] the last chance to present the original affidavit today,” he said, adding that Rana Shamim voiced concerns of affidavit being leaked after leaking it himself.

The court also directed the respondents to submit their replies within seven days and adjourned the hearing for November 26. The others include The News editor-in-chief and the newspaper’s editor.
Shamim was not present for today’s proceedings presided over by IHC CJ. During the hearing, Shamim’s son told the court that the ex-judge had reached Islamabad the night before and was felling unwell. He also asked permission to play a video in the court and to bring a laptop into the courtroom. However, the request was denied.
At the outset of the hearing, the IHC CJ said that it was necessary to restore people’s faith in the judiciary.
Addressing Editior In Chief , Justice Minallah said that a former judge was issued a notice by the court due to a story carried in the newspaper he publishes.
The IHC CJ said that he had full confidence in his judges. “This case would not exist if I did not have confidence in them. Every judge in this court has maintained the public’s faith.”
He said that judges were also accountable and noted that it was a citizen’s right to criticise them.
He also questioned whether a newspaper’s editorial policy allowed it to publish a story on its front page which cited an affidavit that was filed in London, and directed the senior journalist to read the headline of the story out loud.
The story in question was titled “Ex-CJ GB claims in signed affidavit: ‘Saqib Nisar directed not to release Nawaz, Maryam before 2018 elections'”.
“This affidavit is not a part of any court record. Where was this notarised?” Justice Minallah asked, adding that this concerned the credibility of the higher courts.
Meanwhile, coming down hard on the senior journalist, the IHC CJ questioned whether he had checked the date of the court’s order against Maryam and Nawaz. “You are an expert at investigating, did you investigate yourself?”
He also asked the senior journalist whether he had checked who was part of the bench hearing the cases against the PML-N leaders, adding that he and Justice Aamer Farooq were abroad when the appeal was filed and the case was fixed for hearing.
“Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Miangul Hassan were present in the country at the time. Did you inquire about this from the high court registrar?”
He observed that noted lawyers were part of the case against the PML-N leaders. “Did you ask them if they had requested for a date before the general elections?”
He said that Khawaja Haris was the petitioner at the time. “Did you check with him about the bench hearing the case?”
He remarked that “scandals” were being perpetuated to ruin people’s trust in the country’s institutions.
“If another judge spoke like this in front of me I would get in touch with the Supreme Judicial Council,” he said.
“A person witnesses the CJP asking someone to commit a crime. The person stays silent for three years and an affidavit concerning the incident surfaces. How can a newspaper publish such a document?” he asked.
When the senior journalist requested for permission to speak in court, the IHC CJ replied “you have already caused enough damage”.
“I was the one who gave the story, you can take action against me,” the senior journalist said, adding that he had done so in an effort to protect the sanctity of the court.
“A former GB judge is levelling an allegation against a former CJP. Take action against me but also carry out an investigation,” senior journalist said.
During the hearing, Shamim’s lawyer also asked the IHC CJ whether the court would take notice of the statements made by Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda. According to news reports, the minister had stated that the former judge should be hanged and flogged in public for levelling the allegations against Nisar.
However, the court refused to include it in the case and told Shamim’s lawyer to file a separate appeal.
A day earlier, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah, under the Contempt of Court Ordinance, took notice of the report, which claimed that in 2018 Nisar influenced judicial proceedings to prolong the detention of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz following their conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference.

The parliamentary speaker announced that Assad garnered 95.1 per cent of the votes cast, trouncing two virtually unknown challengers.
Standing against him were former state minister Abdallah Salloum Abdallah and Mahmud Merhi, a member of the so-called tolerated opposition, long dismissed by exiled opposition leaders as an extension of the regime.
In the last multi-candidate poll in 2014, Assad bagged 88 per cent of the votes.
Huge election posters glorifying Assad had mushroomed across two-third of the country under his control in the lead-up to Wednesday’s poll.
Before the election results were announced, tens of thousands of Syrians gathered on Thursday in various cities to celebrate, waving Syrian flags and carrying pictures of Assad, the state media reported.
The festivities broke out after the election committee, quoted by the local media, said “the ballot counting process has been completed in the majority of Syrian provinces.”
“Tens of thousands of people in the Tartus province gathered at the city’s seafront to celebrate” Assad’s expected win, according to state news agency SANA.
Some danced and beat drums, footage broadcast by Syrian television showed.
Thousands of other Syrians rallied in the coastal city of Latakia and in Umayyad Square in the capital, Damascus, which along with Tartus and Latakia are bastions of the regime.
Celebrations were also underway in Aleppo and in Sweida, in Syria’s south, where a crowd gathered in front of city hall, the state media said.
Houwayda al-Nidal, a 52-year-old doctor, said that Assad’s victory “carries two messages”.
The first is that of a leader who has won the war and will lead the reconstruction, he said, and “the second is intended for foreigners to show who will lead political talks after the end of the fighting on the ground.”
The election was held on Wednesday in government-held areas and the state media showed long queues forming outside polling stations, which remained open five hours past the planned closing time.
The vote took place amid the lowest levels of violence since the war erupted in Syria in 2011 — but with the economy in free fall.
Assad’s campaign slogan – “Hope through work” – evoked the colossal reconstruction needed to rebuild the country, requiring billions of dollars in funding.
He was first elected by referendum in 2000, after the death of his father Hafez al-Assad, who had ruled Syria for 30 years.

Several websites have also published reports based on this claim.
AFWA probeThe interview in question has been carried by several news websites. Had Luc given such a shocking statement, it would have surely been carried by international media. But we did not find any such statement attributed to Luc in any credible media outlet.
On the right of the viral video, a logo of “Rair Foundation USA” can be seen. We did a keyword search and found the article on the website of “Rair Foundation USA”, which describes itself as a grassroots activist organisation.
In this report too, it isn’t written anywhere that people receiving a vaccination for Covid-19 will die within two years. It is pertinent to mention here that, a viral statement attributed to French virologist and Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier has left netizens startled and scared. As per this statement, all those who have vaccinated themselves for Covid-19 will die within two years.
A clip of Luc’s interview is being circulated on social media in which he’s seen questioning the idea of vaccinating people during the pandemic.
“It’s unthinkable to vaccinate during a pandemic. They’re silent. It is the antibodies produced by the virus that enable the infection to become stronger. It is what we call antibody-dependent enhancement, which means antibodies favour a certain infection. It is clear that the new variants are created by antibody-mediated selection due to the vaccination,” Luc says in the French interview.
Fake Claims In Twitter Post
A Twitter user shared the video with the caption: All vaccinated people will die within 2 years. Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier has confirmed that there is no chance of survival for people who have received any form of the vaccine. In the shocking interview, the world’s leading virologist stated bluntly: “There is no hope…”
What Luc said
The Nobel laureate has called mass vaccination against coronavirus during the pandemic “unthinkable” and a historic blunder that is “creating the variants” and leading to deaths from the disease. He has also raised concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).
According to the Mary Ann Liebert “Coronavirus Resource Center,” virus-specific antibodies are in general considered antiviral and play an important role in controlling infections in a number of ways.
However, in some instances, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This activity is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ADE of virus infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of the virus, and in some cases, the replication of the virus.
The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has also refuted the claim, calling it fake.
Luc’s history of controversial statementsLuc Montagnier was the joint recipient (along with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Harald Zur Hausen) of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, his nomination had led to massive controversy as there were allegations of theft and deception against him.
Thereafter, Luc created several controversies with his statements.
Last year, he’d said that the deadly coronavirus was manufactured in a laboratory in China’s Wuhan. Though this theory is yet to receive validation, it had created quite a sensation back then.
As per the French news website “The Connexion”, just one year after winning the Nobel prize, he had claimed that a good immune system was enough to protect people against AIDS. The report also says that Luc is known for being anti-vaccination, pro-homoeopathy, and believes that “water has memory”.
In 2017, he had opposed the French government’s decision to make certain vaccinations mandatory, accusing the policy of “poisoning the next generation little by little”. In response, 106 academicians and scientists had written an open letter, alleging that one of their peers is using his Nobel Prize status to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge.
Thus, it is clear that though Luc Montagnier has indeed raised concerns around vaccination during the Covid-19 pandemic, but he has not said anything like people who vaccinate themselves will die within two years.

Islamabad: Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed dampened the opposition’s hopes on Monday after he observed that no one can stop the government from promulgating the ordinance regarding open balloting in the Senate elections.
This was observed by the Supreme Court while hearing the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam’s petition filed against the Election Amendment Ordinance that seeks to conduct the forthcoming Senate elections through open voting.
On Saturday, President Dr Arif Alvi signed off the ordinance as the government still awaited the SC’s opinion on whether open balloting could take place without a constitutional amendment.
However, the CJP observed that, “I think they [government] entered the domain of speculations. I don’t know how they did it. No one can stop them.”
Justice Gulzar further added that, “If we hold that the Senate elections is under the Constitution, then the ordinance will die down.”
Commenting during the hearing, Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan questioned how the ordinance was a preemptive attempt at legislation, adding that if anyone who has an objection with it can approach the high court.
At this, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Javed Khan said that the ordinance was not preemptive but also a conditional legislation. He questioned the politicians terming it as an attack on parliament or the top court.
Justice Ahsan observed that according to a news report, the government promulgated the ordinance because the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had scheduled the Senate elections for February 11.
At the onset of the hearing, JUI-F’s counsel Kamran Murtaza argued that the government did not respect the court proceedings and promulgated an ordinance over a matter that was sub judice.
He requested the court to look into the matter. The counsel also stated that never before have legislation been passed in this manner before.
The bench, however, issued notice to the AGP over the JUI-F’s petition.

989,Govt Asks Opposition To Refrain From Dragging National Institutions Into Politics,https://abbtakk.tv/en/govt-asks-opposition-to-refrain-from-dragging-national-institutions-into-politics/,"September 21, 2020","Islamabad: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has asked the opposition to refrain from dragging national institutions to politics as it will not serve interest of Pakistan.
Addressing at a joint news conference in Islamabad on Monday, along with Information Minister Syed Shibli Faraz, Planning Minister Asad Umar, and Minister for Science and Technology Chaudhry Fawad Hussain the Foreign Minister said yesterday’s conference of the opposition reflected their desperation for not getting any concession or National Reconciliation Ordinance from the government.
He rejected opposition’s objections on foreign policy of the country saying that the entire world is acknowledging Pakistan’s role as facilitator in the Afghan Peace Process.
Shah Mehmood Qureshi said it is a great achievement that now intra-Afghan negotiations have begun for lasting peace in the country.
Regarding Kashmir issue, the Foreign Minister said Prime Minister has vociferously raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, Organization of Islamic Countries, world human rights bodies and other global forums.
He said it seems strange that on the one hand, the opposition is criticizing government’s Kashmir policy; while on the other hand, they had supported government to get passed resolutions on Kashmir unanimously from the parliament.
Refuting opposition’s claim that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is being rolled back, Shah Mahmood Qureshi said all the projects of CPEC are rolling on and will be completed within the stipulated time period.
Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Syed Shibli Faraz said former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his speech yesterday had raised suspicions about the election process because he is not used to a free and fair election. He said opposition is making state institutions controversial, which is not a service either to the country or the democracy. He said the opposition should come up with solid suggestions for free and fair elections instead of maligning the entire election process.
Syed Shibli Faraz said Nawaz Sharif is living in London on the pretext of health issues, but apparently he seems hale and hearty.
Asad Umar said opposition is doing all these gimmicks to protect its corruption and properties. He regretted the approach adopted by the opposition for personal gains. He said opposition’s narrative is very close to anti-Pakistan forces. He said unfortunately, the opposition has waged war on state institutions, including the military, judiciary, and National Accountability Bureau for not acting to its dictates.
The Planning Minister said former rulers had deliberately created an economic crisis in the country to give tough time to the PTI Government. He said the government successfully overcome this challenge and faded all the hopes of the opposition to trample the new dispensation. He said it is regrettable that the opposition opposed the Financial Action Task Force related legislation to prevent Pakistan from falling into FATF’s black list and to bring the country out of its grey list. He said yesterday’s speeches by the opposition leaders were celebrated in India.
Asad Umar said one should keep in mind that democratic system is fully functioning in Pakistan, while civilian and the military leadership is collectively working hard to take the country forward. He said the government and the military are collaborating in all matters, including COVID-19, locust attack, realization of Karachi transformational programme, and development in Balochistan.
Minister for Science and Technology Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said the government set new traditions of tolerance by allowing live broadcast of speeches of opposition leaders. He said Nawaz Sharif wanted to use institutions to protect his corruption and on refusal he used to turn against them, which is evident from the fact that the former Prime Minister had failed to develop working relationships with any of Army Chief during his three terms as chief executive of the country.

990,Pakistan Researchers Among Winners of Facebook Misinformation Project,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-researchers-among-winners-of-facebook-misinformation-project/,"August 13, 2020","Facebook announced the winners of its Foundation Integrity Research: Misinformation and Polarization request for proposals.
Among the global list of winners are Ayesha Ali, Agha Ali Raza and Ihsan Ayyub Qazi from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), whose proposal shone during the competitive selection process.
Misinformation and polarization are fundamental challenges Facebook faces, not just as a company with the mission of bringing people together but also as members of societies dealing with layered challenges ranging from election interference to a global pandemic.
At the end of February, Facebook Research launched a request for proposals focusing on these dual challenges. “Our goal is to support independent research that will contribute to the understanding of these phenomena and, in the long term, help us improve our policies, interventions, and tooling,” said Alex Leavitt, Senior Researcher at Facebook.
Ayesha Ali, Agha Ali Raza and Ihsan Ayyub Qazi’s research sets out to measure the role of prior beliefs and analytical reasoning, and how this impacts the beliefs of internet users, as well as to design an educational intervention that uses influential public figures to spread awareness about misinformation in order to reduce polarization, among other goals.
The winning team shared “We are thrilled to have our research been awarded the grant by Facebook which would serve as a stepping stone for us to take our project forward. Through our research, we aim to understand how non-textual misinformation (e.g. deepfakes) is perceived by internet users with low digital literacy, and the role of pre-conceived notions and analytical reasoning in shaping the beliefs of such users. We are hopeful that by the completion of this project, we will be able to make a substantial contribution towards combating the circulation of false and unverified information on the internet.”
Facebook opened a request for proposals for academic institutions or non-governmental organizations from all over the world in February this year. This resulted in over 1,000 proposals being received from 77 countries altogether. Out of these, 25 awardees have been finalized, who will be investigating issues across 42 countries including Canada, Denmark, Pakistan, Turkey and the UK.
Proposals were evaluated by a selection committee which comprised of members from Facebook’s research and policy teams.
The winners’ areas of research included health, politics, digital literacy, and news, while the research itself is not restricted to Facebook apps and technology.

991,Afghan Government Releases 100 Taliban Prisoners,https://abbtakk.tv/en/afghan-government-releases-100-taliban-prisoners/,"April 9, 2020","KABUL: The Afghan government has released 100 Taliban prisoners, a government official said, a day after the armed group said it was walking out of talks with Kabul.
Javid Faisal, spokesman for Afghanistan’s Office of the National Security Council, said: “The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan released 100 Taliban prisoners today based on their health condition, age and length of remaining sentence, as part of our efforts for peace.”
The Taliban had accused the Afghan government of delaying the prisoner swap that was part of an agreement signed with the United States in the Qatari capital, Doha.
The two foes have been negotiating since last week to try to finalise the prisoner swap that was originally supposed to have happened by March 10 and pave the way for “intra-Afghan” peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
But the swap has been beset with problems, with Kabul claiming the Taliban wants 15 “top commanders” to be released, while the armed group has accused Afghan authorities of needlessly wasting time.
The US signed the deal with the Taliban on February 29 that required the Afghan government – which was not a signatory to the agreement – to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners, and for the armed group to release 1,000 pro-government captives in return.
As per the terms of the deal, Washington promised to withdraw US and foreign troops from Afghanistan by July next year, in return for security guarantees from the Taliban.
On Tuesday, Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, said the group recalled its negotiators from Kabul, hours after it suspended talks on the prisoner exchange with the Afghan government.
“The intentional delays in the release of our prisoners violates the peace agreement, therefore we call back our technical team back from Kabul,” Shaheen said in a tweet.
Despite the setback over the prisoner releases, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said progress had been made since he visited Kabul on March 23 to press Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud over the results of a disputed September election.
“We’ve made some progress, but we see them posturing in the media, we see statements that come out,” he told a State Department news conference.
While the feud has persisted, Pompeo’s visit and his announcement of a $1bn cut in US aid to Afghanistan appeared to have an impact, with Ghani on March 26 announcing a delegation for peace talks with the Taliban that won Abdullah’s endorsement.

Afghan local news channel reported international representatives, including US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and US and NATO forces commander General Scott Miller, attended Ghani’s inauguration at the Presidential palace in the capital, Kabul.
Abdullah Abdullah rejected the presidential election results announced last month, saying Ghani’s win was invalid because of vote-rigging in a repeat of the 2014 elections marred by fraud.
He held his own ceremony coinciding with Ghani’s, suggesting talks between the two camps and Khalilzad, the US envoy aimed at brokering an agreement had not been successful.
Earlier on Monday, Abdullah agreed to suspend his swearing-in event on the condition that Ghani follow suit. But Ghani, who was declared the winner of September’s election, decided to go ahead with his inauguration.
The two men issued invitations last week to parallel swearing-in ceremonies on Monday, after Abdullah disputed the February 18 decision by the Electoral Commission and proclaimed himself a winner.

News portals carried pictures of profusely bleeding Aishe Ghosh, the leftist president of the JNU students union (JNUSU). TV grabs showed masked men roaming freely on the campus, and students said the police and security guards refused to respond to calls for help.
Reports said the masked men belonged to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), students wing of the Hindu fascist Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

Several teachers independently confirmed ABVP members had entered the campus and were attacking students.
“Female students have locked themselves up inside the girls’ wing in Sabarmati Hostel. These attackers are roaming the corridors armed with rods and sticks…we are under attack,” the JNUSU Twitter handle said.
A video of a bleeding Ms Ghosh was posted on Twitter while the JNUSU said in a statement that a large number of ABVP activists had entered the campus with iron rods and told to “single out” students’ representatives.
Characteristically, the ABVP offered a rival version. It claimed its members, including its JNU unit secretary, were attacked by members of the left-backed students’ outfits and 11 of the RSS-affiliated outfit’s members were missing.

1004,Street Clashes Erupt As Venezuela’s Guaido Urges Uprising,https://abbtakk.tv/en/street-clashes-erupt-as-venezuelas-guaido-urges-uprising/,"April 30, 2019","CARACAS:  Anti-government demonstrators clashed with troops loyal to Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro at an air base in the capital hours after opposition leader Juan Guaidó took to the streets in a bold and risky attempt to lead a military uprising against the embattled socialist.
The early-morning rebellion seems to have only limited military support.
But it was by far the most-serious challenge yet to Maduro’s rule since Guaidó, with the backing of the U.S. and dozens of other countries, declared himself the country’s interim president in January in rejection of a government he accused of stealing last year’s presidential election.
The dramatic events began early Tuesday when Guaidó, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armored crowd control vehicles, released a three-minute video filmed near a Caracas air base in which he called on civilians and others in the armed forces to join a final push to topple Maduro.
In a surprise, standing alongside him was Leopoldo Lopez, his political mentor and the nation’s most-prominent opposition activist, who has largely been silent and unseen since he was detained in 2014 for leading a previous round of anti-government unrest. Lopez said he had been released from house arrest by security forces adhering to order from Guaidó.
“I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers,” Lopez declared.
As the two opposition leaders coordinated actions from vehicles parked on a highway overpass, troops loyal to Maduro sporadically fired tear gas from inside the adjacent Carlota air base.
The events, playing out in the opposition’s stronghold in a wealthier neighborhood of eastern Caracas, appeared not to have triggered a broader military revolt.
Flanked by top military commanders, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López appeared on national television and condemned Guaido’s move as a “terrorist” act that was bound to fail.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the “right-wing extremists” would not succeed in fracturing the armed forces, which have largely stood with the socialist leader throughout the months of turmoil.
“Since 2002, we’ve seen the same pattern,” he a news agency adding that most of Caracas was calm. “They call for violence, a coup, and send people into the streets so that there are confrontations and deaths. And then from the blood they try to construct a narrative,”
Hundreds of government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered at the presidential palace, answering the call by socialist leaders to come to the embattled Maduro’s rescue.
Guaidó said the troops who had taken to the streets were protecting Venezuela’s constitution and that in the coming hours he would release a list of top commanders supporting the uprising.
Anti-government demonstrators gathered in several other cities, although there were no reports that Guaidó’s supporters had taken control of any military installations.
“The armed forces have taken the right decision,” said Guaidó. “With the support of the Venezuelan people and the backing of our constitution, they are on the right side of history.”
As events unfolded, governments from around the world expressed a mix of support for Guaidó while reiterating calls to avoid violent confrontation.
U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, in a Twitter post directed at defense minister Padrino, said the armed forces “must protect the Constitution and the Venezuelan people.”
Meanwhile, Spain’s caretaker government urged restraint, while the governments of Cuba and Bolivia reiterated their support for Maduro.

1005,Early Indonesia Results Show Widodo In Lead,https://abbtakk.tv/en/early-indonesia-results-show-widodo-in-lead/,"April 17, 2019","JAKARTA: More than 190 million Indonesians cast a ballot, with a record 245,000 candidates running for public office in the world’s third-biggest democracy, from the presidency and parliamentary seats to local positions.
Early preliminary results in Indonesia’s presidential election show President Joko Widodo ahead of challenger Prabowo Subianto by 10 to 12 percentage points.
The so-called “quick counts” from reputable survey organizations that use a sample of polling stations have been reliable in past elections.
With between 40 and 50 percent of sample polling stations counted, four polling organizations showed Widodo winning 54 to 56 percent of the votes.
Official results from the Election Commission are expected in May.
Indonesians have voted in one of the world’s biggest one-day elections on Wednesday in a race to lead the world’s most populous Muslim country.

More than 190 million Indonesians cast a ballot as polls opened shortly after 7:00 am local time (2200 GMT Tuesday) in restive Papua.
The vote ended at 1:00 pm (0600 GMT) in Sumatra at the other end of the volcano-dotted archipelago.
Some voters went to their local mosque before casting ballots, as the daily call to prayer sounded across a nation that is nearly 90 percent Muslim.
Opinion polls show Widodo, 57, is a clear favorite – but he faces a tough challenge from Subianto, 67, who has leaned on a fiery nationalist ticket and warned he will challenge the results over voter-list irregularities if he loses.
Subianto narrowly lost to Widodo in 2014 elections, and unsuccessfully challenged those results.
Voters will flock to more than 800,000 polling stations where they’ll punch holes in ballots – to make clear their candidate choice – and then dip a finger in ink, a measure to prevent double-voting in a graft-riddled country where ballot buying is rife.
The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800 kilometers across more than 17,000 islands with a population of more than 260 million, including hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.
Officials are moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and – as well as elephants and horses – to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.
The poll has been punctuated by bitter mudslinging and a slew of fake news online that threatens to sway millions of undecided voters.
Widodo has campaigned on his ambitious drive to build much-needed roads, airports and other infrastructure across Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Raised in a bamboo shack in a riverside slum, the soft-spoken Widodo stands in stark contrast to Subianto, whose strongman image is underscored by a penchant for slamming lecterns as he accuses Jakarta of selling the country off to foreign interests.
Subianto – joined by running mate Sandiaga Uno, a 49-year-old wealthy financier -takes a page from US President Donald Trump, vowed to put “Indonesia first” by reviewing billions of dollars in Chinese investment.
Subianto’s long-held presidential ambitions have been dogged by strong ties to the Suharto family and a chequered past.

It is viewed in the review petition that the judicial verdict raised an impression that Pakistan armed forces were violating their oath while it was stated without any solid proof.
The petition categorically said that armed forces chief directed to take departmental action against unknown persons in the light of the court verdict while Intelligence Bureau, Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI), police and defense ministry submitted several responses into the court regarding the Faizabad verdict.
“Allegations on the armed forces and ISI in the court verdict are totally baseless while the orders given to armed forces are also vague and unclear as the verdict did not provide any evidence and proof of any person of armed forces involvement in the sit-in,” it argued.
The petition insisted that observation given against the armed forces and the ISI be clipped from the SC judgment while the SC observation was solely based on newspapers and assumptions.
The SC verdict also gives an impression that the armed forces also involved in banning media and the general elections held in 2018 while armed forces were called for security arrangements for ensuring free and fair elections. During the general elections, military personnel had to report to wrongdoings to the presiding officer and duty officer of armed forces had authority to take immediate action and DG Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) gave his statement in this regard. Armed forces provided their services for the protective environment and overseeing wrongdoings in the general elections held in 2018.
It was also argued that enemies and foreign forces have been accusing Pakistan army of facilitating extremists in the region and, therefore, the court verdict as a whole benefitting false narrative regarding army assisting extremists adding that if the SC judgment is not reviewed then India will get the opportunity for false propaganda against Pakistan.
The petition also mentioned that the Faizabad sit-in and Asghar Khan case have major difference while no evidence and proofs were provided regarding any person belonging to armed forces involvement in the Faizabad sit-in and for other allegations.
It was also stated in the review petition that no notices served to armed forces before announcing the judgment.

The top court in its 43-page verdict released by two-member bench comprising Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Mushir Alam stated that any institution should not cross boundaries of the Constitution.
Sensitive institutions were directed to monitor people spreading hatred and endangering national security while federal and provincial governments were also ordered to hold monitoring of such persons involved in discussions of terrorism, extremism and hatred, stated the verdict released on SC’s website.
Every citizen has right to create political parties, gathering and protests including political activists. According to verdict, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was registered as political party while any political party was restricted to propagate against constitution and political parties cannot be involved in terrorism under Election Act.
“The maintenance of public order is the paramount duty of the State. If anyone propagates, “hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Federal or Provincial Government”55 they commit the offence of sedition for which the punishment is imprisonment for life.”
“The Constitution does not specifically stipulate a right to protest. However, democracy recognizes such a right, and it was through democratic means that Pakistan was achieved.”
“Citizens have the right to peacefully protest and hold demonstrations, and may do so against any action or decision of a government or authority.”
“Every citizen not being in the service of Pakistan shall have the right to form or be a member of a political party”63, however, as this fundamental right itself stipulates, it is one which vests in every citizen of Pakistan. Political parties must not act in a manner, “prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan”64 and they “shall account for the source of funds”65. TLP was registered as a political party on 25th May, 201766 under the Political Parties Order, 2002.

Election Commission of Pakistan was directed to take action against political parties violating laws and rejecting to provide details of its funds.
“The Constitution earmarks the responsibilities of the Election Commission which it must fulfill. If a political party does not comply with the law governing political parties then the Election Commission must proceed against it in accordance with the law. The law is most certainly not cosmetic as contended on behalf of the Election Commission.”
The verdict quoted Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s statements:
The top court ordered the federation to “always act impartially and fairly” as “the law is applicable to all, including those who are in government and institutions must act independently of those in government.”
“When the State failed to prosecute those at the highest echelons of government who were responsible for the murder and attempted murder of peaceful citizens on the streets of Karachi on 12th May, 2007 it set a bad precedent and encouraged others to resort to violence to achieve their agendas.”
“A person issuing an edict or fatwa, which harms another or puts another in harm’s way, must be criminally prosecuted under the Pakistan Penal Code, the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and/or the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.”
“All intelligence agencies (including ISI, IB and MI) and the ISPR must not exceed their respective mandates. They cannot curtail the freedom of speech and expression and do not have the authority to interfere with broadcasts and publications, in the management of broadcasters, publishers and in the distribution of newspapers.”
The verdict added, “The Constitution emphatically prohibits members of the Armed Forces from engaging in any kind of political activity, which includes supporting a political party, faction or individual. The Government of Pakistan through the Ministry of Defence and the respective Chiefs of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are directed to initiate action against the personnel under their command who are found to have violated their oath.”

1010,"Quitting Facebook Makes People Happier, Study Finds",https://abbtakk.tv/en/quitting-facebook-makes-people-happier-study-finds/,"February 4, 2019","Washington: Quitting Facebook makes people happier, less engaged with news, and more likely to spend time with friends and family, according to a study.
Researchers at Stanford University and New York University also found that once people quit Facebook temporarily, they spend less time online overall, ditching other websites for real-world interactions too.
A new study titled ‘The Welfare Effects of Social Media’ asked almost 3,000 moderate Facebook users to log out for a month to see what happened.
The findings are released just as Facebook marks its 15th birthday, having expanded from a dormitory room hobby project to a network of websites and apps with more than 2.7bn users every month.
The study took place last November, coinciding with the 2018 US midterm elections, and offered 2,844 people $100 to log off for a month.
Those who logged off Facebook for a month found themselves with a lot more free time on their hands: Deactivating Facebook freed up 60 minutes per day for the average person in the study.
However, the research team was surprised to find that, rather than logging on to other websites, people were actually more inclined to switch off entirely from their digital connections and spend more time watching TV, socialising with friends and family, or exercising.
Participants also found that they were much happier after they logged out of their Facebook accounts. This is consistent with findings in other studies.
“Deactivation caused small but significant improvements in well-being, and in particular on self- reported happiness, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety,” they wrote.
Another of key outcome of the study is that participants consumed less news when they weren’t using Facebook.
News knowledge and attention to politics declined and participants were “less able to correctly answer factual questions about recent news events”.
There was no detectable effect on political engagement but deactivation “significantly reduced polarisation of views on policy issues”.
The final point of the study was to look at whether logging off Facebook for a month had any long-term impact on whether people were likely to start using the platform again once the study had ended.
Several weeks after the study ended, those who had deactivated Facebook were using the app 12 minutes less than those in the control group, who had kept using the app during the study.
Five percent of those who had deactivated their accounts had not reactivated them nine weeks after the experiment ended.

This opens up an opportunity for Pakistan to secure their only third win on South African soil with their team, especially the batting, starting to look in better shape after adapting to the conditions.
The touring party failed to cross the 200-run mark in their first three innings but left a strong impression in the fourth as fifties by Shan Masood, Asad Shafiq and Babar Azam in Cape Town not only saw their side post 291 runs on the board but also made the South African pace battery toil for wickets.
But as it is often the case with a Pakistani camp on away tours, all is not rosy after their captain claimed that his fast bowlers did not bowl up to the mark. According to some reports coming out of the dressing room, it left the pacers distressed.
Despite South Africa already having won the series, there’s still a lot for Pakistan that can be achieved at the Wanderers. They have never won a Test at the venue. And with a five-match ODI series to follow after the Tests, a win is certain to lift the team’s morale.
Team News
South Africa: Dean Elgar will lead the home side in the absence of du Plessis. Cape Cobras’ one-drop Zubayr Hamza is set to make his Test debut. He is likely to be slotted at the number six position. Faf’s suspension provides out-of-form Theunis de Bruyn with another opportunity to make a mark for himself at the Test level. The 26-year-old has scored only 56 runs across four innings. Since his debut in March 2017, de Bruyn has averaged a paltry 19.33.
The home side have also called up an uncapped opener Pieter Malan as a possible replacement for Aiden Markram. After scoring a fighting 78, which was 26 runs more than he had scored in his last three Tests, in the first innings of the second Test, the right-hander did not join Elgar as an opener in the second innings as he nursed a thigh problem. Markram will face a late fitness test.

Early results showed Hasina racing into a clear lead, winning each of the first 29 seats declared — some by tens of thousands of votes — according to Channel 24, which is compiling results from around the country.
The deadly violence and bitter rivalry that marred the election campaign spilled over into voting day, even as authorities imposed tight security with 600,000 troops, police and other security forces deployed across the country.Ten people were killed in clashes between Hasina’s ruling Awami League party and supporters of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, police said, while three men were shot by police who said they were protecting polling booths.
An auxiliary police member was also killed by armed opposition activists, according to officials.
Hasina, 71, has been lauded for boosting economic growth in the poor South Asian nation during her decade in power and for welcoming Rohingya refugees fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar.
But critics accuse her of authoritarianism and crippling the opposition — including arch-rival Khaleda Zia who is serving 17 years in prison on graft charges — to cling on to power.
The BNP-led opposition alliance Sunday accused Hasina’s party of using stuffed ballot boxes and other illegal means to fix the result, which was to be announced Monday.
BNP spokesman Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal told reporters there were “irregularities” in 221 of the 300 seats contested. Its Islamist ally Jamaat-e-Islami said it would reject the results.“Voters are not allowed to enter booths. Especially women voters are being forced to vote for the boat,” Alal said, referring to the Awami League symbol.

1021,FIA Asks SC to Close Asghar Khan Case Over Lack of Evidence,https://abbtakk.tv/en/asghar-khan-case-fia-asks-sc-to-close-case/,"December 29, 2018","Islamabad (December 29, 2018): Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has requested the Supreme Court to close the Asghar Khan case related to the alleged distribution of money among politicians, including former premier Nawaz Sharif, to defeat the PPP in the 1990 general elections.
According to sources, FIA submitted a report to the top court today, stating that it has no evidence enough to initiate proceedings against those named in the case.
The politicians who were accused of receiving money denied doing so in their statements, it added.The report said there were gaps and contradiction in the statements of witnesses in the 25-year-old matter. Besides, there was no record of transactions made through banks, it added.
In his reply, PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had earlier categorically stated that he never received Rs3.5 million from the former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for the campaign in 1990 elections.He denied that he had received Rs3.5 million or Rs2.5 million from ISI director general Lt Gen Asad Durrani or the then owner of now defunct Mehran Bank Younis Habib.
Mr. Sharif stated that he had already recorded his statement in this case on Oct 14, 2015.
Nonetheless, Supreme Court fixed December 31st as the date of hearing for the Asghar Khan case.A three-member bench of the apex court comprising Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, Justice Faisal Arab and Justice Munib Akhtar will take up the case.
At the previous hearing, the court had directed the Attorney General for Pakistan and the Director-General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to provide details of the progress made to implement the landmark court verdict in the Asghar Khan case.
Justice Saqib had noted that the court will fix the responsibility on those who did not implement the verdict, despite a lapse of many years.The court had also rejected the petitions filed by former army chief Gen (retd) Mirza Aslam Beg and DG ISI Lt-Gen (Retd) Asad Durrani to review the short verdict passed by the top court on October 19, 2012 on a petition of Air Marshal (retd) Asghar Khan, who died on January 5, 2018.
In the short order, the apex court had directed the federal government to initiate action against the Gen Beg and Gen Durrani for their role in dishing out Rs140 million to the group of politicians.
In its November 8, 2012 detailed judgment, the Supreme Court had ordered the FIA to initiate proceedings against the politicians, including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had allegedly been given a total of Rs140 million with the objective of blocking chances of the Pakistan Peoples Party’s victory in the 1990 general election.
The 140-page detailed judgment, authored by the then CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, had emphasized that all officers who obeyed unlawful commands were individually liable and in the event of failure of the state authorities to take action, the rights of the people of Pakistan were to be upheld by the Supreme Court.The verdict had conceded that the 1990 general election was polluted by doling out Rs140 million to a particular group of politicians only to deprive the people of the chance of being represented by their chosen representatives.
It also held that the President of Pakistan, Chief of the Army Staff, ISI DG or their subordinates certainly were not supposed to create an ‘Election Cell’ or to support a political party/group of political parties, because if they did so, the citizens would fail to elect their representatives in an honest, fair and free process of election, and their actions would negate the constitutional mandate on the subject.
According to the judgment, an election cell was established in the presidency to influence the general election of 1990. Then army chief Gen Beg and then ISI DG Lt-Gen Durrani participated in the unlawful activities of the election cell in violation of the responsibilities of the army and ISI as institutions, which was an act of individuals, but not of the institution they represented.The judgment also said that the ISI or MI may perform their duties as per laws to safeguard the borders of Pakistan or to provide civil aid to the federal government, but such organizations have no role to play in political activities or politics, for formulation or destabilization of political governments, nor can they facilitate or show favour to a political party or group of political parties or politicians individually, in any manner, which may lead in his or their success.
In 1996, retired Air Marshal Asghar Khan wrote a letter to the then CJP Nasim Hassan Shah alleging that the then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, then army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg, then director general ISI Lt Gen Asad Durrani and then head of Habib Bank Sindh and owner of now defunct Mehran Bank, Younis Habib had doled out Rs140 million among several politicians ahead of 1990 polls to ensure Benazir Bhutto’s defeat in the general elections.

“He is the best chief minster in Pakistan,” said Bilawal talking to the media hours after the government issued a list of people whose names have been put on the Exit Control List (ECL).
The PPP chairman said he would not make any compromise on the 18th amendment to the constitution and also denied that his party seeks any NRO with government.
Bilawal criticized the government for not moving against Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, and Naeemul Haq, demanding across the board accountability in the country.He said the “puppet government” has usurped basic human rights of people and undermined the federation.
Bilawal said there was a lot of resentment in different parts of the country.
The PPP chairman also hinted at launching a protest movement.
Earlier, addressing public gathering in Ghotki, Pakistan Peoples Party president Asif Ali Zardari on Friday warned that no one can scare away his party leadership and assured his supporters that there is nothing to be frightened of.
The former president told the participants not to be scared as “no one can scare us away”.

“A nation that is united and aware of its rights cannot be made to back down. No one can scare your leadership,” Zardari said.

A country only becomes stronger when its people are happy.”The PPP leader said he would face down any one who attempted to challenge him. “We have been in opposition even after winning elections [in the past]. We come here to serve the public, not to serve ourselves,” he added.
It is his party’s philosophy to give rights to the poor first, the former president reminded.

The PPP co-chairman said that he faced the opponent’s tactics earlier too and will not back down from facing them again.

Shortly after Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry announced that the federal cabinet has decided to place on the ECL all 172 suspects named in a joint investigation team’s report in the fake bank accounts case, Zardari, who is named in the aforesaid JIT report, went on the offensive, saying: “Today, the thugs of the ladla have challenged us. We are not afraid of their tactics.
“They have started to sound like a broken record… Apart from uttering gibberish on Television, they don’t know what to do,” he remarked.
He said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is his and Benazir Bhutto’s son and no one can scare him.“We are all Bhuttos and we are ready to fight them on every front including the courts,” said the former president.
“Those who know how to work know that 100 days are more than enough,” said Zardari, adding that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government got ample time to deliver through governance.
The PPP co-chairman, while heavily criticising the government, said that the PTI-led government thoroughly lacks competence and fresh perspective to govern.
PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari vowed to fight his political opponents “in court and everywhere else” soon after it emerged that his name could be placed on the exit control list (ECL) in connection with the fake bank accounts case.“As far as Bilawal [Bhutto] is concerned, he is mine and BB’s son: how can you scare him?” he asked.
Zardari, who made scarce mention of his slain wife in a speech meant to mark Benazir Bhutto’s 11th death anniversary in Garhi Khuda Bukhsh, criticised the incumbent PTI government and claimed that they pale in comparison to the performance of the PPP government.
“They did nothing in their 100 days,” he said, reminding the party supporters that he had ousted General Musharraf, “launched the Benazir [Income Support Programme] card” in his first 100 days.
“They will be unable to run the country despite foreign support by friendly countries,” he said.The PPP has organised a central congregation in her hometown Garhi Khuda Bakhsh in Larkana district of Sindh.
Benazir took oath as the first female prime minister of Pakistan on December 2, 1988. She was also the first woman to lead a Muslim state and twice served as the prime minister of Pakistan.
The former premier was assassinated in a gun and bomb attack in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007.

Senior Superintendent (SSP) of district South Karachi, Pir Muhammad Shah, confirmed that the guard has been taken into custody. Shah said that the guard belonged to Dera Ghazi Khan and was hired 2-3 months ago for the job.
According to the SSP, instead of retaliating to the fire by the assailants, the guard went inside the house after the gunmen opened fire at the ex-MNA.
Earlier yesterday night (December 25), Former MQM lawmaker and Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Syed Ali Raza Abidi was shot dead in Karachi’s DHA neighbourhood.

Initial reports suggested that unidentified assailants opened fire on his vehicle outside his residence at Khayaban-e-Ghazi in DHA Phase-V.
According to Police, the shooting incident took place in Defense’s Khayaban-e-Ittehad area when an unknown gunman opened fire on Abidi’s vehicle and fled.
SSP South told media that Abidi was shot in head and neck as soon as he got off his car outside his home.
“It was premature to conclude whether the assailants were riding a bike or a car,” he said.Police and Rangers personnel have cordoned off the site of the attack and are collecting evidence.
Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Syed Kaleem Imam has taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police authorities.
This comes two days after two Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) workers were gunned down in Usmania Society.
Earlier this month, six people were wounded when a low-intensity blast hit an MQM’s Milad gathering in Gulistan-e-Johar.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has taken notice of the shooting and directed police chief to submit a report.Abidi, who had been affiliated with Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), had resigned from basic membership of the party in September citing “personal reasons”.
“This is to bring to your attention that I will not be able to continue participation with MQM Pakistan due to personal reasons,” he had said in his resignation letter to MQM-P Convenor Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Abidi was one of the leaders who had stood with former convener Farooq Sattar in the buildup to 2018 elections when MQM-P was subject to an internal power battle.
He was the owner of the famous Karachi eatery, Biryani of the Seas.
Profile of Ali Raza Abidi
Former MQM lawmaker and Former Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Syed Ali Raza Abidi’s affiliation with MQM goes back to the 1988, when he was a student of SM Commerce College. When the army operation against the party started, Abidi – who had seen several tortured bodies of his colleagues – distanced himself from politics.
Although he went to the United States for his undergraduate degree in science and business management from Boston University, he had once said that he was in touch with what was going on back home. “It was disturbing at time and I felt helpless.”
After coming back in 1998, he chose to be an entrepreneur – he was part of distributing Walls ice cream, and later joined the seafood processing business Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) run by the family.Abidi’s father, Syed Ikhlaq Hussain Abidi, was also actively involved with the MQM and was an MNA from NA-250.
Abidi jumped back into active politics in 2008, and formed the Professionals Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) for MQM.
His career in politics began in 2013 when he was given the ticket by MQM to contest elections. Being his first time in elections he was able to win and got himself a seat in the national assembly.
However, there was some controversy surrounding his seat as a MNA as he allegedly resigned from his position recently when he joined Pak Sarzameen Party and thus left MQM.
He was member of the National Assembly, from June 2013 to May 2018.He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) from Constituency NA-251 (Karachi-XIII) in Pakistani general election, 2013. He received 81,603 votes and defeated Raja Azhar Khan, a candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
The former MQM leader was a well-educated politician and did his immediate schooling from Karachi St. Patrick School. He got his B.com degree from DHA Degree College and I.com degree from S.M Commerce College. Then he went to states to complete his marketing degree from Boston University.
Ali Raza Abidi had plenty of experience in marketing sector and was the CEO of Akhlaq enterprises.

“This is to bring to your attention that I will not be able to continue participation with MQM Pakistan due to personal reasons,” he had said in his resignation letter to MQM-P Convenor Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Abidi was one of the leaders who had stood with former convener Farooq Sattar in the buildup to 2018 elections when MQM-P was subject to an internal power battle.
He was the owner of the famous Karachi eatery, Biryani of the Seas.
Abidi was quite active on Twitter, with his last tweet coming just four hours before the fatal attack on him.
The counter press conference by PTI is just repetition of what they have been alleging for the past 5 years on the container. Nothing new nor substantial in reply to PMLN's presser, except that now PTI is officially speaking on behalf of NAB Courts.

Initial reports suggested that unidentified assailants opened fire on his vehicle outside his residence at Khayaban-e-Ghazi in DHA Phase-V.

According to Police, the shooting incident took place in Defense’s Khayaban-e-Ittehad area.
It has been learnt that Abidi had gone there to meet his relatives and had just sat in his car after meeting them, when unknown assailants opened fire on the vehicle.
According to police, unknown gunmen opened fire on Abidi’s vehicle and sped away.
SSP South told media that Abidi was shot in head and neck as soon as he got off his car outside his home.
“It was premature to conclude whether the assailants were riding a bike or a car,” he said.Police and Rangers personnel have cordoned off the site of the attack and are collecting evidence.
Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Syed Kaleem Imam has taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police authorities.
This comes two days after two Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) workers were gunned down in Usmania Society.
Earlier this month, six people were wounded when a low-intensity blast hit an MQM’s Milad gathering in Gulistan-e-Johar.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has taken notice of the shooting and directed police chief to submit a report.Abidi, who had been affiliated with Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), had resigned from basic membership of the party in September citing “personal reasons”.
“This is to bring to your attention that I will not be able to continue participation with MQM Pakistan due to personal reasons,” he had said in his resignation letter to MQM-P Convenor Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Abidi was one of the leaders who had stood with former convener Farooq Sattar in the buildup to 2018 elections when MQM-P was subject to an internal power battle.
He was the owner of the famous Karachi eatery, Biryani of the Seas.
Abidi was quite active on Twitter, with his last tweet coming just four hours before the fatal attack on him.
The counter press conference by PTI is just repetition of what they have been alleging for the past 5 years on the container. Nothing new nor substantial in reply to PMLN’s presser, except that now PTI is officially speaking on behalf of NAB Courts.

A large number of people from all walks of life would visit the tomb to pay tribute to Quaid-e-Azam for his services he rendered for the creation of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Sub-continent.Biography:
Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25 December 1876 in Karachi.At home, his family talked in Gujarati language, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English.Except for Fatima Ali jinnah, little is known of his siblings. His father’s name was Jinnah Poonja (1857- 1901) and his mother’s name was Mithibai. Jinnah was the eldest of the seven children of Jinnah Poonja and Mithibai. His family had migrated to Sindh from the Kathiawar area of Gujarat, India In 1891(when he was fifteen), Jinnah went to London and worked for few years for a company. Before going to London, he was married to Emibai.She was his distant relative. At the time of her marriage, Emibai was around 14 or 16 years old. But, Emibai died shortly after Jinnah had gone to London. At around the same time, his mother also died.In 1894, Jinnah quit his job to study law. He joined the course at Lincoln’s Inn and graduated in 1896. While still in London, he also started to participate in politics. He greatly admired Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Gradually Jinnah was developing his own political outlook. He was thinking on the line that India should have a constitutional self-government.Around this time, his father lost his business. This put Jinnah under great difficulty. In the meantime, he had started to practice as a lawyer in Mumbai. He also built a house in Mumbai’s Malabar Hill area. The house is now known as Jinnah House.He became a successful lawyer. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a famous leader of India, once used Jinnah to work as a lawyer. Tilak was facing charges of sedition against the British Raj.On 25 January 1910, Jinnah became a member on the sixty-member Imperial Legislative Council. He was an active member of the Council. Like many other leaders of India At the beginning Jinnah had avoided joining the All India Muslim League, another political organization of India. Muslims had formed the League in 1906. In 1913, Jinnah became a member of the Muslim League. In 1916, he became the president of the Muslim League. He helped in making an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League(Lucknow Pact in 1916).
In 1918, Jinnah married again. His second wife was Rattanbai Petit. She was twenty-four years younger than him. She was the daughter of Jinnah’s personal friend Sir Dinshaw Petit The Jinnah couple resided in Bombay (now Mumbai) and frequently travelled to Europe. In 1919, his wife bore a daughter who was named Dina.Many Muslim leaders of India like Aga Khan III, Coudhary Rahmat Ali and Sir Muhammad Iqbal requested Jinnah to come back to India.The leaders of the Muslim League wanted him to take charge of the Muslim League. Jinnah agreed to come back to India. In 1934, he left London and returned to India to reorganize the Muslim league again. But he could not revive the stature of the party until after the elections of 1937 as the Muslim League won only a few seats. However, at this time, the League was helped by the powerful Premier of the Punjab, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan. On October 1937, he agreed with Jinnah’s Muslim League joining his strong government. This was called the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact.His differences with the Congress Party continued to become bigger. In 1930, some Muslim leaders like Allama Iqbal had argued for a separate country for the Muslim people of India. At last he came to the conclusion that Hindus and Muslims cannot live in a single country.Jinnah also started to have the idea of a separate country for Muslims of India. Jinnah and the Muslim League started work to get such a separate country. They made a plan for this in 1940 called the Pakistan Resolution. This new country was to be named Pakistan.In 1941, Jinnah founded a newspaper, named the Dawn. This newspaper published the views and political thinking of the Muslim League.After the Second World War, Great Britain started steps to give independence to India. On 16 May 1946, the British announced plan for a united India. One month after, on 16 June 1946, the British announced another plan to partition the British Raj into two countries, one for the Hindus and one for the Muslims.The Congress Party accepted the plan of the 16 May 1946. The Muslim League under Jinnah’s leadership accepted both the plans. But, on 16 August 1946, Jinnah also announced the Direct Action to achieve independence for Pakistan, a separate country of Muslims of the former British Raj. After several rounds of discussion, the British Raj was partitioned (in August 1947) into two countries, India and Pakistan. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan.The British Raj of India was partitioned into two countries, namely, India and Pakistan. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan, his sister Fatimah Jinnah became the “Mother of the Nation”. He also became the president of Pakistan’s constituent assembly. In an address to the constituent assembly on 11 August 1947, Jinnah told about the future of Pakistan as a secular state. He told this in the following words:You may belong to any religion caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the state. In due course of time, Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state
Jinnah had been suffering from tuberculosis since the early 1940s. Only his sister, and very few other persons close to the family knew this. After partition of India and creation of Pakistan, he had become the governor general of Pakistan. His work was increased, but his health was deteriorating. To regain his health, he spent many months at his official rest house. The rest house was located at a place named in Ziarat. Jinnah could not regain his health. He died on 11 September 1948 from tuberculosis and lung cancer.At the place of his funeral, the government of Pakistan has constructed a big mausoleum. His house named Jinnah House is under the possession of the government of India. The government of India wants to give the house to the government of Pakistan. But, the position is not clear till now.

“Punishment to the same man for the fourth time. [This was] blind revenge’s last hiccup but victory is Nawaz Sharif’s, thank God.
“After two-and-a-half years of revenge-like accountability, after rummaging through three generations, not a penny’s worth of corruption, kickback or commission was found.”
Maryam claimed that “all the verdicts against Sharif were regarding the personal business of his deceased father (Mian Sharif)”, adding that “when they could not find anything they announced the verdict on assumptions.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz also finalized preparations for the public contact campaign if PML-N Supremo gets arrested today, sources added.
UK-based Flagship Investment Limited
The charge against the family is that Hassan Nawaz, the former premier’s youngest son, set up an investment firm in 2001, with an office registered in the United Kingdom. At the time he was 25-years-old.Earlier this month, during a hearing, the NAB stated that Nawaz Sharif even received an amount of 0.78 million AED from the investment firm that he claims to have no stake in.
The accountability court had to determine how and from where did Hasan get the funds to set up the investment firm?
Al-Azizia Steel Mills
Hussain Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister’s elder son, claims that he received a sum of $5.4 million from his grandfather to establish the steel conglomerate in Saudi Arabia.
The payment was made by a Qatari royal on the request of the elder Sharif. Thereafter, scrap machinery was transported from their Ahli Steel Mills in Dubai to Jeddah to establish Al-Azizia in 2001.The JIT constituted to investigate the graft allegations insist that the real owner of the mills was Nawaz Sharif, and it was being operated by his son on his behalf. Hussain was 29-years-old at the time.
The JIT also held that Nawaz Sharif received 97 per cent profit as ‘gifts’ from Hill Metals Establishment, another company established by Hussain Nawaz Sharif in 2005, in Saudi Arabia.
Of the amount, Nawaz Sharif transferred 77 per cent to his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif. (Maryam is not accused in this reference).
Here as well, the NAB claims that since Sharif received a large profit from Hussain’s companies, he is the real owner and not his son.

1047,Palestinian President Announces Parliament Dissolution,https://abbtakk.tv/en/palestinian-president-abbas-dissolves-parliament/,"December 23, 2018","Ghaza (December 23, 2018): Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has announced that the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) was to be dissolved and that parliamentary elections will take place within six months.
The Palestinian Legislative Council, which is the Authority’s law-making body, has been de facto inactive for the last 11 years, since the 2007 split between Hamas and Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah.

Abbas’ announcement is the latest in a series of bitter splits and rivalries between his Fatah party and Hamas, which began in 2007 when Hamas routed his forces and took over Gaza, keeping his rule limited to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Since then, the Palestinian Legislative Council, where Hamas holds a majority after a 2006 landslide victory against Fatah, has been largely disabled. If done, breaking up the legislature would remain symbolic, maintaining the already entrenched political divide between Gaza and the West Bank.
“We resorted to the Constitutional Court and the court decided to dissolve the PLC and called for parliamentary elections in six months and we have to execute this (decision) immediately,” Abbas told a Palestinian Liberation organisation meeting in Ramallah.He also accused Hamas of blocking Egyptian efforts to restore Palestinian unity, a charge Hamas vehemently denies. Abbas says the dissolution of the parliament aims to pressure Hamas into accepting proposals for national reconciliation.

Earlier, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday said only parliament can take decisions for the nation,
Addressing a public gathering in Hyderabad, Asif Zardari said that”individuals with three-year terms” have no right to do so.

“Only parliament has this right and no one else.”

Without naming anyone, he said that they keep visiting different places, questioning, “What does you have to do [with them]?
“There have been 900,000 case pending in courts, you should look into those,” Zardari said.
“You have no future, why do you decide about the future of things? I say it even today that one should act remaining with legal and constitutional bounds.”
He said only parliament has the right to make decisions about the nation. “It was better that transparent elections were allowed to be held and political parties could have formed a government through consensus.”Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman and former president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari jumped down Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Government’s throat saying that they have no idea what to do with the country which has resulted in increasing bewilderment among the nation.
“People sitting in Islamabad are blind, dumb and deaf,” he declared.
Criticising the government, he said that government functionaries say 100 days were less for them and what could they do such a short period.
“We got rid of Musharraf in 100 days, we got Swat freed in 100 days,” the PPP co-chairman noted, recalling his party’s tenure in the centre.
He said only a party of the masses could understand their needs and problems, not the “parties that are made.”Zardari said if he could run a government in a good way then it did not imply he could also play good cricket.
“I don’t know how to play cricket. I know politics and I can do that,” he said. “Politics is when Musharraf reached home and said ‘I don’t know what happened and how it happened’.”
He suggested the government to provide opportunities to local businessmen and facilitate stock exchange, adding, “Only technology and experts should be invited from abroad.”
former president said the PTI-led government is busy in vanishing the jobs of people rather providing it to them as 0.5 million persons have been deprived from their employment.During his aggressive speech, Zardari said that the opponents have no courage to deprive him from his rights however; he is hurt whenever the rights of poor are snatched from them.
“Efforts are being made to abrogate Benazir Income Support Program but we will not let it happen,” he asserted.
“The incumbent government is inefficient and can do nothing besides the hen and eggs. It would have been better that the government was formed with mutual consent,” said PPP co-chairman.
“Please stop cracking shavie with Pakistan as you had already poked much fun at nation. The country is always pushed fifteen years back; if the local businessmen are not happy then how is it possible that foreign investors will invest here.”

1060,Australia Recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel’s Capital,https://abbtakk.tv/en/australia-recognizes-west-jerusalem-as-israels-capital/,"December 15, 2018","Sydney (December 15, 2018): Australia formally recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of Middle East policy, but will not move its embassy there immediately, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday.
“Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,” Morrison said.
“We look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem when practical,” he told reporters in Sydney.
Morrison said in October he was open to shifting Australia’s embassy from Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in May delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies.Morrison’s unexpected announcement in October was viewed cynically because it came days before a crucial by-election in an electorate with a strong Jewish representation, a poll his party subsequently lost.
It also drew criticism from Muslim-majority neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia, neither of whom formally recognize Israel’s right to exist. Arab countries worried that the move would unnecessarily inflame tensions in the Middle East.
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 Middle East war, and wants all embassies based there. The international community believes Jerusalem’s status should be resolved through negotiation.
The status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians who want East Jerusalem recognized as the capital of a Palestinian state.
Morrison said Australia would not move its embassy to West Jerusalem until the city’s final status was determined, but said trade and defense offices would be opened there.
He confirmed Australia’s support for a two-state solution with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.
“What we are saying is we’ve got to move this forward. The rancid stalemate has to be broken,” he said.

1061,Pakistan In No Rush To Strike Deal With IMF: Finance Minister,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-in-no-rush-to-strike-deal-with-imf-finance-minister/,"December 15, 2018","Business Desk (December 15, 2018): Finance Minister Asad Umar said that Pakistan is in no rush to strike a deal with International Monetary Fund to deal with its balance-of-payments issue.
In an interview with Saudi daily Arab News, he said that funding from friendly countries would help shore up the economy over the remaining current financial year.
Asad Umar said that we are in discussions with IMF and trying to reach the outlines of the program. However, he said that we will go ahead and sign the programme only if it is in the best interests of Pakistan’s economy.
The Finance Minister said that Pakistan has satisfied all concerns raised by the IMF and US officials with regard to CPEC.About trade with India, he ruled out any discussions in this regard before general elections there next year. Asad Umar said that Pakistan would not take any unilateral step to grant Most Favoured Nation trade status to India.
On the government’s promise of attracting investment from overseas Pakistanis, he said that rules for a diaspora bond were approved by the Cabinet a week ago and the bond would be issued late this month or next month.
“The recent support has resulted in a current account deficit of $6-7 billion less than the previous financial year,” the finance minister claimed. “Funding from “friendly countries” would help shore up the economy over the remainder of the current financial year,” he added.
Referring to the $6-billion package agreed with Saudi Arabia this October and expected aid from China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Umar added, “So I’ve saved $6-7 billion of my financing need and then I’ve arranged funding from bilateral sources to bridge the gap.”
When asked how much aid Pakistan expects from China and UAE, Umar refused to provide a figure for packages but said that, in both cases, it was just a case of “dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s” on the agreements.Turning to the recent plummeting that the rupee took against the dollar Umar denied that the government had allowed the rupee’s value to drop in order to fulfill a precondition of an IMF bailout. “The main sticking point in negotiations with the organisation was the pace of reforms,” Umar added.
“We believe that if you try and make reforms too quickly, if you try and make an adjustment too quickly, you’ll crash the economy. And that is not in our interests, not even from a debt-sustainability point of view,” he asserted.
CPEC plans review not off the table
Responding to a question regarding reviewing agreements related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) programme was off the table, Umar said: “Not at all.”“The IMF had a lot of questions. The Americans had a lot of questions around CPEC,” he said. “We made a presentation, we shared the data with them — first meeting. They never came back after that.”
He added new projects slated to be added to the CPEC portfolio included a railway line from the port city of Karachi to the northwestern town of Peshawar and the establishment of special industrial zones.
“There are a few other projects in the area of the industrial cooperation framework that is being finalised, and which will lay the basis on which future industrial cooperation will take place, private sector-to-private sector,” Umar said. “So, from government-to-government, which is what the first phase of CPEC was, it will be moving to business-to-business.”
Explaining the Saudi aid package, Umar said $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year and a further loan of up to $3 billion in deferred payments for oil imports, the finance minister said $1 billion of the $6 billion package had been disbursed so far.“It’s not a rescue package, it’s a financing package,” he said. “Saudi Arabia will earn a rate of return on that investment.”
He explained that the pending agreements with China and the UAE were also not aid packages: “These are all financial transactions. There are loans, there are trade finance facilities. Pakistan is not taking aid from anyone.”
No trade talks with India before 2019 elections
Turning to the recent World Bank report which stated that trade between India and Pakistan was far below its potential of $37 billion, the minister said Pakistan was ready to engage in a constructive trade dialogue with its neighbour but “it can’t be a one-sided relationship”.
However, he ruled out any discussions on trade with India before general elections there in 2019 and said that Pakistan would not take “any kind of unilateral step” when it came to granting India Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status.On the government’s promise of attracting investment from Pakistanis living abroad, the finance minister said rules for a diaspora bond were approved by the Cabinet a week ago and the bond would be issued late December or January.
“There are equity-related or investment opportunity-related diaspora investments which are being finalised. The board of investment has worked on them; there was a presentation to the prime minister today (Thursday) about some of those,” Umar said. “First the diaspora bonds will be launched and then these initiatives will follow quickly after.”

1062,Trump’s Son-in-Law Possible Next Chief of Staff,https://abbtakk.tv/en/trumps-son-in-law-possible-next-chief-of-staff/,"December 14, 2018","Washington (December 14, 2018): Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is on the short-list of potential candidates for the president’s next chief of staff, US media said.
Kushner, an influential White House adviser and husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, met with Republican leaders to discuss the job.
“I am not aware that he is under consideration but, as I think all of us here would recognize, he would be great in any role that the president chooses to put him in,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said of the news, which was also reported.
The president has been searching in vain for a new chief of staff after announcing that John Kelly, a retired general he had reportedly fallen out with, was to leave by the end of the year.
Nick Ayres, the 36-year-old chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, had been touted as favorite to get the job, but announced he was taking himself out of the running, dealing a blow to the president.
Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who heads the hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives, showed more interest — but also ultimately withdrew his candidacy.
Kushner was a key player in negotiations with Canada and Mexico to preserve a free trade pact between the North American countries.
He has also led efforts to draft a Middle East peace plan that the Trump administration said it will unveil in early 2019.
The 37-year-old has also cultivated close ties with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is accused of playing a role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a case that has rattled the kingdom’s ties with the West.
The news is sure to set off warnings of nepotism, however, especially considering that Kushner had no prior experience in government before Trump’s election.
Like his father-in-law, he left New York real estate to become one of Washington’s most powerful political players.

“The real problem of this government is that it lies. The 26 MoUs were signed by Ishaq Dar.”She added that the PTI government would steal the projects of the PML-N. “An example is when the plate of Shehbaz Sharif was removed and replaced with Imran Khan’s at the Sialkot University.”
According to Aurangzeb, all the projects launched by the PTI government would actually be those which were initiated by the PML-N. “Allah has taken away prosperity from this government due to their lying.”

Background of 18th Amendment:
The constitution of Pakistan was amended under the influence of president Parvez Musharaf through the 17 amendment act in December 2003. The amendment enhanced the powers of president (and governors) and the Legal Framework Order (2002) was incorporated in the constitution.
The exiled opposition leaders (Benazir and Nawaz) signed Charter of Democracy ( London, 2006) that pledged the restoration of the constitution in its original form. The same was reasserted by the All Parties Conference (London, 2007), attended by the representative of 37 opposition political parties. Its declaration opposed the Musharaf’s regime.Pakistan Peoples Party was victorious in the general elections held in 2008. A Parliamentary Committee for Constitutional Reforms under the chairmanship of Senator Raza Rabbani was established in 2009. The 27-member committee was composed of all the representative of Parliamentary political parties.
The central points of PCCR suggestions were:
To undo the 17th Amendment Act ; to enhance federalism ; and parliamentary structure of the constitution.
The Amendment:
Finally the suggestions of the PCCR were incorporated in the constitution as 18th Amendment Act on 20th April 2010.
Salient Features :
Renamed N-WFP as Khyber Pakhtunkha, Sind as Sindh and Baluchistan as Balochistan.
Reduced the powers of presidents (and governors).
Omitted the Concurrent Legislative List in order to enhance provincial autonomy.
The name of Gen. Zia ul Haq was removed from the text of the constitution.
Becoming PM or CM for more than two times was allowed.
The appointment of superior judges was changed, however, this aspect of the amendment was challenged in Supreme Court of Pakistan and then the procedure was refined through 19th Amendment Act (January 1st, 2011).
The amendment did not discuss the fate of FATA.

Record of our family’s source of income from 1937 is available.”

1076,Probe in Rigging: Opposition Rejects Govt TORs,https://abbtakk.tv/en/probe-in-rigging-opposition-rejects-govt-tors/,"December 3, 2018","Islamabad (December 03, 2018): A sub-committee formed by the special parliamentary committee probing the allegations of rigging in the July 25 general elections, on Monday issued the government’s ’33-word long’ terms of reference (ToR) and handed them over to the opposition.
According to the government’s brief ToR, the parliamentary committee will hold an inquiry to determine that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) organised and conducted the 2018 general elections “honestly, justly, fairly clean and in accordance with law and guarded against corrupt practices”.

The opposition has asked for time till December 13 to reply to the government’s ToR.Though the opposition parties have submitted their ToR, the government members of the committee are still questioning the legal status of the parliamentary committee in the light of Article 225 of the Constitution.
On Monday, the meeting of sub-committee was held under the chairmanship of its convenor, Education Min­ister Shaf­qat Mahmood. PPP’s Nav­eed Qamar, PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah and MQM-P’s Barrister Moh­ammad Ali Saif also attended the meeting.
The sub-committee was formed on November 10 to finalise the ToR.
During the last meeting of the sub-committee, the opposition parties had submitted a 10-point raising crucial questions over the conduct of polls.
The ToR was prepared by the PPP and endorsed by all other opposition parties, including the PML-N.
Talking to media persons following today’s session, Mehmood maintained that the “general elections were transparent, according to the law and constitutional requirements”.The minister said Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) and the European Union had also published their reports in this regard. He was of the view that the opposition parties were only “trying to make the elections controversial and political”.
Mehmood said that according to Clause 218 of the Constitution, the government has suggested the finest ToR which “covered all aspects of the opposition’s demands”. “The finest investigation will be conducted while staying within the ambit of the Constitution,” he added.Responding to a question regarding the legal status of the parliamentary committee, Mehmood said a reference in this regard was sent to the committee’s chairman, Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, who then forwarded it to National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for further action.
PPP Reaction
While speaking to the media, PPP’s Qamar said that from the government’s methodology it was clear from the very first day that they don’t want to make progress.
“ToR is a simple issue,” he said, adding, “the government had basically penned down its constitutional responsibility as ToR.”
Qamar added that in their suggestions the government had made the ToR “very short”, saying the government wanted a better case to escape, however, “the opposition would not let them escape”.
“All opposition parties will be in mutual consultation about the situation,” he maintained.
PML-N’s Sanaullah added that the very fundamental thing was that the elections were not transparent and that the political parties had not been given a level playing field.
He said that their suggestion was to boycott the parliament but PPP had not agreed and chosen the way of holding parliamentary committee investigations instead.
“The committee has been formed but the government wants a way to escape somehow,” he said adding that if the way through parliamentary committee was the stopped the other way was through protests.
He added that the government and oppositions ToR should be sent to a central committee which should take the final decision on the ToR.

“Please remember, we are trying to make institutions autonomous,” he said. “We have made SBP autonomous, they took the decision because they deem it fit.”
He said the previous PML-N government had left a trade deficit of $19 billion, which increased from a previous deficit of $2.5 billion.
“The PML-N govt had spent $7 billion to maintain the value of rupee,” he said.He lamented that there were better education institutes for elite.
“There is good justice system for elites. The rich can afford good lawyers, they can even get away with robbery; while the poor can’t get justice in time,” he said.
“Likewise for jobs, people from elite institutions get jobs easily. So, we’re bringing reforms, uniform education systems, then Health cards for medical care and legal aid for those who can’t afford.”
To a question, he said that he talked about poultry and livestock and people made fun of him.
“Bill Gates explained the same thing next day and people are taking it to be something highly out of the box. We’re a livestock nation, that’s the best way to alleviate the poverty” he said.“Halal meat trade is worth 2000 bn USD, worldwide. We are a livestock nation. We can make the most of this opportunity area.”
Speaking about a case of alleged abuse of power on by federal minister Azam Swati, Khan said he does not interfere in the matters of institutions to protect anyone.
“We will obey the court orders. Azam Swati will resign if found guilty,” he said.
Khan expressed “regret” over remarks by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar in which the top judge pointed to alleged nepotism on Khan’s part in the appointment of Zulfi Bukhari’s as the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development.
To a question, PM Khan said that the kind of situation we inherited, was unprecedented.
“We’re lucky that we are still getting investments otherwise when your country is in such a deficit, investments naturally become hard. But we are adamant. I’m working harder than I have ever done.”
“For revamping institutions like Railway, PIA, Steel mills etc, we have studied and in process of implementing from 2 models, Singaporean and Malaysian.”Khan said that his administration was not intervening in any institution.
“Interior Ministry is under me, CDA comes under me, yet they are freely issuing reports against my own place in Bani Gala. This is unprecedented.”
He said that Azam Swati would resign if he was found guilty of misuse of powers.
“If Azam Swati’s misuse of power is proved, he will himself resign. JIT is formed by SC and it is independent. I have never intervened in this case although I head the deptt that is investigating Azam Swati.”
“There was a complaint against a Police officer that he misbehaved with Bushra bibi’s daughter. Doesn’t the Chief Executive of a province have the authority to at least summon that officer and ask him about the matter?”
“My own sister’s name is being discussed. Have I ever interfered in the investigations? ,” he questioned.
Khan said that  Pakistan’s sad reality was that “we go after the honest businessmen even. That’s why Pakistan has the least ease of business. I have met business community to hear their grievances and ensure we resolve them.”
“We are having one-window operations for ease of doing business. Lack of ease of doing business destroys Small businesses. Every institution asks them for the bribe. So we are reforming that system.”PM Hints Early Election
Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday hinted at the early general election in the country.
Responding to a question, the premier maintained that the formation of South Punjab province is a lengthy phase.
“It is quite likely that early general elections are held in the country. Changes in ministries can also occur,” he said.

Old Minded Beaurucrates
Prime Minister Khan said the nation would have to decide whether “it wants to let corruption prevail”.
He cited the example of China is ridding itself of corruption. “China is sailing past the US in economy, they have convicted 400 ministers during the past five years,” he noted.
Khan said the major hurdle in his government’s anti-corruption plans are some “old-minded bureaucrats” who are “going slow [and] creating an impression that the government will not be able to run”.
“We have recovered land worth trillions of rupees,” he said. “Mafias are behind real encroachments. We have asked the authorities not to target poor people but the mafias.”
“FBR, FIA and the anti-corruption [watchdog] are working under the government. We have signed agreements on data sharing of each others’ citizens with 26 countries.”
Sharing an “interesting aspect” of the drive, Khan said the UAE and Saudi Arabia had refused to share the data of Pakistani iqama holders saying it was equivalent to sharing their citizenship information. “Now, you’ll know why iqamas were sought secretly,” he remarked.

1078,"Enough Evidence to Indict PM Netanyahu, Israeli Police",https://abbtakk.tv/en/israeli-police-says-enough-evidence-to-indict-pm-netanyahu/,"December 2, 2018","Jerusalem (December 02, 2018): Israeli police said on Sunday that there is enough evidence to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a third corruption investigation.
According to a police statement, authorities found evidence of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust.

Police also said there is enough evidence to charge the Israeli leader’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, with fraud, receiving bribes, and interfering with an investigation.
The case, known as Case 4000, is one of the largest facing the Israeli leader and his inner circle. It deals with the relationship between the Ministry of Communications — then under Netanyahu — and Israeli telecommunications firm Bezeq.Investigators say Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Bezeq, and Netanyahu’s friend. In exchange, prosecutors say Elovitch gave Netanyahu favourable news coverage in online news site Walla! News, which is owned by Elovitch.
Police say there is enough evidence to charge Elovitch with bribery, interfering with an investigation, and financial crimes.
Both Netanyahu and Elovitch have denied any wrongdoing.
In response to the police statement, Netanyahu said, “The police recommendations against me and my wife do not surprise anyone. These recommendations were decided and leaked before the investigation had even begun. The police recommendations have no legal standing.”
“There was nothing because there is nothing,” he concluded.In Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having received gifts from businessmen overseas totaling 1 million shekels (approximately $280,000), including cigars, champagne, jewelry and more, from 2007 through 2016.
The second case, called Case 2000, involves conversations Netanyahu had with Arnon Mozes, the owner of one of Israel’s leading newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth, which is regularly critical of the Prime Minister.Opposition demands Resignation
Israeli opposition leaders on Sunday called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign after police recommended indicting him over bribery charges.
“Netanyahu must go home before he destroys the law enforcement in order to save his own skin,” Tzipi Livni, leader of the Zionist Union party, wrote on Twitter.
“The people of Israel deserve a clean leadership. Elections now!”

I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!” Trump tweeted after departing for the G20 summit.
Trump’s tweet was a sudden turnaround. Roughly an hour earlier, he had told reporters he would probably meet with Putin at the summit and said it was “a very good time to have the meeting.”

But Trump had also said he would get a final report during the flight to Argentina on the tension in the region after Russia seized Ukrainian vessels near Crimea on Sunday.
Differences over Ukraine, as well as Moscow’s role in the civil war in Syria, have been an irritant in US-Russian relations for years.The administration of former President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. That in part brought ties between Washington and Moscow to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War.
Since then, the United States has investigated Russia’s possible interference in the 2016 presidential election that Trump won. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has repeatedly said there was no collusion.

One Legislation:
While several bills have been drafted by the PTI government, it could only pass one legislation, the Financial Supplementary (Amendment) Bill 2018 on October 3. (according to the FAFEN findings)
Five U-Turns:
• Presenting an emergency supplementary budget, Asad Umar, the finance minister, announced that non-filers will be allowed to purchase new cars and property. Umar said the decision was taken to facilitate overseas Pakistanis. However, a few weeks later the government rescinded the tax-benefit granted to non-filers.
• The government appointed Atif R. Mian, a Princeton University economist, to the PM-led Economic Advisory Council. But then removed him under pressure from the religious political parties. The decision was seen as an about-turn as the information minister had earlier defended the appointment.
• The prime minister pledged to grant citizenship to the Afghan and Bengali refugees born in Pakistan. Imran Khan later backtracked and told the parliament that no such decision had yet been taken.
• In a televised address, Prime Minister Imran Khan warned rioting leaders of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) political party that the writ of the state will be imposed, if the protesters continue to block streets. However, three-days later, his ministers signed a peace agreement with the TLP.
• After much dithering, and weighing up other options, the new government began talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package. In 2014, while in the opposition Imran Khan had severely criticised the then-ruling party’s decision to seek assistance from the lending body. Analysts and political leaders saw this as yet another about-face by the leader.
Zero U-Turns on Imran Khan’s statement about U-Turns, in which he defended his habit to rollback decisions taken earlier and called the trait a “hallmark of great leadership.”
7 percent Inflation:Pakistan’s annual inflation rate is recorded at 7 per cent in October, the highest in four years. The surge has been attributed to hike in gas prices and the currency devaluation.
The PM House has held five auctions to sell 102 luxury vehicles of the PM House. Of which only 64 have been sold so far, (Breakdown: 62 on Sep. 17, 1 on October 7, 3 on October 25, 1 on November 7).
Eight buffaloes being kept at the Prime Minister house went on sale and were quickly picked up by buyers.
Foreign Dignitaries in Pakistan:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was the first foreign dignitary to visit the country after PTI assumed power. Zarif met senior military and civilian officials.
The government’s first 100 days also saw diplomatic visits by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was accompanied by Chairman of Joint Chief of Staff General Joseph Dunford and Trump’s special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. Talks were first held with the foreign minister and then with Prime Minister Imran Khan.China’s foreign minister also arrived in Pakistan. During his stay, the top Chinese official held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and met PM Imran as well as the Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
No head of state visited Pakistan during the first 100 days of PTI’s government.
Civil-military Meetings:
The army chief called on PM Imran four times during the first 100 days. The first visit came after the PM assumed office, the second before Pompeo’s visit to discuss Pak-US relations.
In the third meeting, the COAS was accompanied by ISI chief Naveed Mukhtar.
Imran, army chief meet ahead of Pompeo’s visit.The fourth meeting came after PM Imran’s visit to China, where both discussed the visit as well the security situation after TLP’s country-wide protests.

Speaking about his cricketing days, PM Imran said, “There were two kinds of cricketers — one who were scared of losing and took no chances and the other who took risks and were always successful.” The premier continued that when he entered politics he also came across two kinds of politicians. “One who sacrificed the public good for their own benefit and the other who thought about the society, did not spread hate, took chances and big decisions as well.”The premier added, “All of Pakistan’s institutions are on the same page today.”

So, if there can be no war then what other way is there other than friendship?” the premier said.
“I invite Sidhu to contest elections from Pakistan’s Punjab and I know he will win. Hopefully we will not have to wait for Sidhu to become prime minister for relations to improve between the two countries and before that, Indian leadership will take positive steps,” PM Imran joked.
Prime Minister Imran Khan lauded the happiness and joy on the faces around him.
“Happiness I saw today was like of those Muslims who are standing 4 km away from Medina on other side of the border, but are unable to visit it, but when they get chance to visit it, the happiness they get is the happiness they are relishing today,” he asserted.
He vowed to improve the facilities at the Kartarpur gurdwara.“It is useless to live in the past. It should only be utilized to learn lessons from mistakes. Our political leaders, our army, and all other institutions are all on one page. We wish to move forward and have a civilized relationship,” PM Khan suggested.
“The only issue between us is Kashmir, all it needs is just two capable leaderships to resolve this issue. Just imagine the potential we have if our relationships get strong,” said the premier.

However, the Indian minister expressed hope that the construction of the corridor would be expedited so that Indian citizens could pay their respects at the Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib.
Earlier on September 23, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain informed media that the federal cabinet has formally approved opening of Kartarpura corridor to facilitate Sikh community of India.
Briefing media in Islamabad on Friday, he said Prime Minister Imran Khan will perform opening of Kartarpur border corridor on Wednesday.

He said that Kartarpur is a sacred place for Sikh community living across the globe.
The Minister said that it was a longstanding desire of the Sikh people to facilitate them in visiting their sacred places so that they can perform their religious rituals there.
He said that visa free entry will be provided to Sikh pilgrims from India and a mechanism in this regard is being finalized.
The Minister said that it will be a mega event and visa relaxation will be offered to Indian journalists enabling them to attend the event.
On the Indian side, the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also approved the development of the Kartarpur corridor from Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district to the International Border. This will give Indian pilgrims easy access to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur on the banks of the Ravi river, in Pakistan, where Guru Nanak Dev spent 18 years.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi compared the Kartarpur border corridor with the Berlin Wall.
A political row had erupted in India after Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan in August this year to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Imran Khan as the Prime Minister.
He claimed that Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had told him that Islamabad would open a corridor to Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan on the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak in 2019.According to Indian media, Sidhu subsequently met External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to initiate talks between India and Pakistan on the Kartarpur corridor issue.
After the meeting, Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said Swaraj accused Sidhu of messing up the Kartarpur Sahib corridor dialogue and misusing the political clearance that he was granted to visit Pakistan.
Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, which is three kilometres from the India-Pakistan border, is the final resting place of Guru Nanak.
Kartarpur Sahib is located across Ravi river in Pakistan and is about four km from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine.

The decision came a day after Russia fired at and captured three Ukrainian vessels, triggering a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.
Parliament was expected to debate the decree later on Monday though a televised session of a parliamentary committee unanimously supported it.Ukrainian legislation on martial law allows for a slew of curbs, including restrictions on movement and peaceful assembly, curfews, and restricting the media, though Poroshenko’s decree made no specific references to such restrictions.
Eleven measures outlined in the decree provide for mobilising reserve forces, organising the air defense of important state facilities and taking urgent steps to bring in enhanced cyber security measures and ensure public order.
There was no mention of a presidential election due to be held in March. Poroshenko’s move has prompted speculation by critics and opposition politicians that he might use it to delay the vote.
A twelfth provision of the decree was not published.

1094,Death Anniversary of Amin Fahim Being Observed,https://abbtakk.tv/en/death-anniversary-of-makhdoom-amin-fahim-observed/,"November 20, 2018","Hala (November 20, 2018): The third death anniversary of veteran politician and senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim is being observed today.
Makhdoom Muhammad Ameen Faheem was born in Hala in Sindh, which is located 200 km off the southern port city of Karachi, on 4 August 1939.
His father, Makhdoom Muhammmad Zaman was the 17th spiritual leader of Sarwari Jammat and as well a powerful feudal figure in the province.His father was one of the prominent 67 participants who laid the foundation of the Pakistan Peoples Party where he was made the senior vice-chairman of the party and PPP was found at his house in Hala, Sindh. Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman ‘Talib ul Mola’ successfully contested in the 1970 general elections and stepped into the national parliament as a member of parliament (MP).
Makhdoom Muhammad Zaman was also offered many high-ranking posts in the time of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, but he refused and chose to stay in Hala and look after his Sarwari Jamaat.
Earning Bachelor of Science in political science from the University of Sindh in 1961, Amin started his political activism in 1970 and contested successfully in the 1970 general elections and was a close ally of Benazir Bhutto during the 1990s.
He is the spiritual figure of the Sarvari Jama’at as well as the prominent sufist in his native province, Sindh. After successfully contesting in the 2008 general elections, he notably stepped down for the candidacy of Prime minister office in favour of Yousaf Raza Gillani.He was a Pakistani populist left-wing figure and a poet. He was the senior vice-chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, Chairman of Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians and Former Chairman of Alliance for Restoration of Democracy.
Makhdoom was offered the post of Prime Minister in 2002 by then President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, keeping in mind his party’s leader Benazir Bhutto’s refusal to appoint Mr. Amin Fahim’s son Makhdoom Jameel Zaman as the Chief Minister Sindh, though he was offered the post of Prime Minister thrice before 1988–1990 and 1993.
He remained loyal to his party and did not accept offers from then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the military dictators. Makhdoom Amin Fahim was the senior vice-chairman of PPP, and is also the Parliamentary Leader, (President) of the same party in the National Assembly.He was twice the Federal Minister in tenure of Benazir Bhutto. He was Communications Minister from December 1988 to August 1990, Railways Minister from December 1988 to March 1989. In the next tenure, he was Minister for Housing and Works from January 1994 to November 1996.
Initially, Makhdoom Amin Fahim was more interested in poetry than politics. However, he had no choice but to jump into the fray as the political heir of Makhdoom family.
He once said, ‘Poetry is my first love. I am still fond of saying verses and reading poetry of others’ His forte is mystic poetry. His poetry speaks about love, Peace, and simplicity.“I have always been fond of the poetry of Maulana Rumi, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, and Sachal Sarmast. Their poetry has left a deep impact on my life. I have learned from them (Poets) to be loyal, to be loved, in good or rainy days”
He further said, ‘I don’t believe in ruling the people. I believe in ruling their hearts. That is why my voters love me, and they never disappointed me’.
Makhdoom Amin Fahim held the slot of Pakistan Peoples Party-Parliamentarians when he died in Karachi on 20th November 2015, after long illness.

Addressing a joint press conference with Special Assistant Iftikhar Durrani in Islamabad, he said details about the misuse of funds and authority are being sent to National Accountability Bureau for investigation.

The Special Assistant said the Prime Minister’s plane was misused during the tenure of previous government as three hundred forty million rupees were illegally spent on air travels.
He said that Mariyum Nawaz used the Prime Minister’s aircraft illegally. He said former Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif spent six hundred million rupees on air travel.
Shahzad Akbar said that the government will ask NAB to hold independent investigation and we are going to hand over the record of Prime Minister House from 2014 to 2018 to NAB.He said that the properties owned by Sharif family in London are also under scrutiny and its details have been sought from British government.
He said that investigative journalists were his closest partners in the responsibility he had been given.
He said that a media channel had broken the news of a property [Frederick Close] located in Central London which “had a current value of 2.2 or 2.3 million pounds”.
Akbar added that the rental income and ownership documents for this property from 2012 to 2016 had been available “but were put away in files”.
According to these documents, the flat in London was under the name of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, the late wife of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.The special assistant to PM said that as the premier and a member of the National Assembly (MNA), it was Nawaz Sharif’s responsibility to declare the ownership of his dependents, including his wife’s.
He said that this declaration could have been made in two ways; on a wealth statement that every citizen is required to submit while declaring his/her spouse’s assets — or as a member of the parliament in the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) forms.
Akbar added that as an MNA, there is also an annual declaration submitted in the assembly.
While holding up a document of the ECP forms and wealth statement, Akbar said that this property had not been shared anywhere and this made it a new case of assets beyond known income.
He said that further investigation of assets beyond known income should be carried out by NAB while tax related liability has been given to the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR).While saying that the case will be pursued by both [NAB and FBR], Akbar added that they have also asked Britain for fresh ownership documents of the concerned property.
Akbar said that according to the land registry, in August 2016 this property was transferred to Hassan Nawaz’s name.
The latest date for its sale is from March 2018, Akbar added.
“We have asked Britain for all these documents and they might come in a week or two. We will put all of that in front of you, what the whole trail of this was — till when this property was under the Sharif family and when they sold it and for how much.”
“The question comes up again which has remained the question in all the cases: where did these properties come from, what was their source of income, and what is their trail of money.“When you don’t declare something and get caught, the first question is where did it come from, you have to declare a source of income for it,” he remarked.
In July this year, an accountability court in its verdict in the Avenfield properties corruption reference had handed the ousted prime minister 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and his daughter Maryam was given 7 years for abetment after she was found “instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father”. Sharif’s son-in-law retired Captain Safdar was given 1 year jail time.
NAB had filed the reference regarding the high-end properties in London, along with two others, on the Supreme Court’s directives in the landmark Panamagate verdict last year which deseated Nawaz as the prime minister.

Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani intervened and more than once asked Fawad to not use “unparliamentary” language, saying that running the House is government’s responsibility and it needs to exercise greater tolerance towards opposition.
Fawad, however, continued with his accusations and asked why opposition members are reminded of decorum of the House only when corruption cases are discussed.He also demanded that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Senator Mushahidullah Khan apologise for impolite comments against Fawad and his family made on Monday in the House.
Sanjrani eventually turned off the mic of Fawad as opposition members started a walkout.
Later, Mushahidullah and Fawad shook hands and called a truce.

“As we’ve continued to investigate, we detected and removed some additional Facebook and Instagram accounts,” head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher said in an update posted at the social network.
While stressing the challenge of identifying the culprits, he noted that a website claiming to be associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russia-based troll farm, published a list of Instagram accounts they said that they had created.Facebook had already shut down most of those accounts, and blocked the rest after an internal investigation, according to Gleicher.
“Ultimately, this effort may have been connected to the IRA, but we aren’t best placed to say definitively whether that is the case,” Gleicher said.
“Trolls have an incentive to claim that their activities are more widespread and influential than may be the case.”
On the eve of the midterm election, Facebook announced it blocked about 30 accounts on its platform and 85 more on Instagram after police warned they may be linked to “foreign entities” trying to interfere.
On Tuesday, the numbers of accounts removed for “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” was raised to 36 at Facebook and 99 at the social network’s Instagram service.

Commenting over protest after Aasia Bibi acquittal in blasphemous case he said that the ruling party was merely reaping what it had sowed while it was in opposition.
He alleged that the last time such protests had taken place, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari had participated in the sit-ins. Governments leaders had also exploited the issue to gain votes, he alleged.It is “divine justice” that the “fire” the ruling party had started has now become impossible for it to extinguish, Khan said, adding that agreements are now being signed with the people who issued statements against state institutions.
“You hindered a country that was speeding towards progress… but today you are unable to even answer whether Aasia [Bibi] is present in the country or not,” the PML-N leader said while addressing the treasury benches.
“The khatm-e-nabuwwat [protesters] that are your foes today were your friends yesterday… is this not ‘divine justice’?”
After an exchange of hot words with several government members over his criticism of Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, who was not present in the house, Khan resumed his broadside against Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party.“They say the three-day [TLP] sit-in resulted in a loss of Rs50 billion per day… why don’t they multiply Rs50bn with 126 days?” he said, in a taunting reference to the 126-day sit-in staged by the PTI in 2014.
“Why didn’t you think then that this was causing loss of the country and people?”

“A registered political party crossed the red line,” he said, referring to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP)
“Are we going to continue tolerating a political party which talks about creating anarchy in the country?” he asked, observing that the Constitution calls for the suspension of a party’s membership if it talks against the country’s sovereignty.
He wondered why the government had opted to “escape” from the national consensus that emerged over the protests and proceeded to enter into a deal with the agitators.
“The interior minister laid all the blame for this on the opposition, which was standing next to you,” he said, addressing the treasury benches.
“The government’s inefficiency spread despair among the people,” he said.
Bill for parliament ratification of govt’s foreign agreements
PPP Senator Raza Rabbani on Monday presented a bill in the Senate that could make it binding upon the government to place agreements and contracts with other countries, donors and international monetary organisations before the parliament for ratification.
The bill titled “Ratification of Foreign Agreements by Parliament Bill, 2018” had been moved by Rabbani, the former Senate chairman, in August.Through the bill, the PPP leader has called upon the government to place a foreign agreement, contract or protocol to be signed with any country before both the houses of the parliament to seek approval of its draft within 15 days of its finalisation.
Speaking in the upper house today, Rabbani said it is a practice in some countries that all agreements are ratified by the parliament.
He explained that the bill would force the government to present in the legislature agreements on which it has negotiated with foreign parties, but before the agreement has been signed.
The parliament will then send its recommendations on the agreement to the relevant ministry, which will inform the parliament about the approval of the suggestions within a specified time.
Commenting on the proposal, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said although he principally had no objections against the bill, there is no uniform practice around the world regarding ratification of agreements and treaties by the parliament.“Many countries do not get agreements ratified by the lawmakers,” he informed the Senate. A situation of uncertainty can be created by frequent amendments to international treaties, on which talks can last for several years, he added.
“A method of review should be devised that doesn’t become a hindrance in the [signing of agreements],” he stressed.
Opposition Leader in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq supported the bill, saying matters like foreign agreements should not stay confined to the executive and that the parliament should have a say in them.
After hearing all opinions on the proposal, Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani sent the bill to the relevant committee.

According to details, the Bahadurabad wing of MQM Pakistan will send a formal notice of Rs 50 crore to each one of them.
Bahadurbad wing leader, Khalid Maqbool claimed that a meeting for reconciliation was arranged by mutual friends on November 6 during which, Sattar demanded to make him convener of the party but he was informed that Khalid Maqbool is party convener now, he added. Bahadurabad wing said, “When Sattar conducted intra-party elections in PIB, he became convener for four years. Now when Khalid Maqbool has been made convener, why should we hold intra-party polls in so hurry.”
Earlier on November 09, following strong criticism by disgruntled former MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan decided to expel him (Farooq Sattar).
The party press releases stated that a session of the Rabita Committee was held in Bahadurabad, in which it was decided not to maintain any contact with Sattar.

MQM-P leader Khawaja Izhar ul Hassan said that the party’s rules and regulations are known to everyone and someone flouting rules cannot stay in the party.
Sattar stepped back from party matters after he was not issued a ticket for the by-election.
He had also resigned from the party’s top decision-making body, Rabita Committee last month. The resignation had come in the backdrop of Sattar’s confirmation that he was consulting with his close friends over an offer he had received from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to join the party. Moreover, differences between Sattar and another leader of the party, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, had intensified prior to the General Elections 2018 held on July 25, following which MQM-P was split into two groups – Sattar’s PIB and Siddiqui’s Bahadurabad faction.

According to details, the petitioner, Cyril Almeida said before the court today that the controversial interview of Nawaz Sharif over Mumbai attack has dented the country’s image and sovereignty.
He further alleged that Abbasi shared crucial details of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting with Nawaz following his statements on the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.
Cyril urged the court to take action against Nawaz over Article 5 and 6. He said that if the high court can dismiss someone’s sentence by negating Article 28 and 39 then how can it not hear such a high profile treason case.To this, Lahore High Court Judge Mian Gul Hasan Aurangzeb remarked that these statements are already presented in the petitioner’s application and the court will release its verdict after thoroughly assessing the application.
Nonetheless, LHC adjourned the hearing of the case till indefinite period.
Earlier on October 22,  a three-member LHC full bench of Lahore High Court (LHC) headed by Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi and comprising Justice Atir Mahmood and Justice Chaudhry Masood Jahangir heard the treason petition against Abbasi, Nawaz and journalist Cyril Almeida.

The bench had directed the former premiers to submit a reply in court today regarding the case. However, former premier Abbasi appeared before the bench today but Nawaz failed to.
Justice Mazhar Ali Naqvi questioned why Nawaz did not appear in court and remarked, “He should have been present for the hearing.”
Nawaz’s counsel, Naseer Bhutta responded, “You had summoned a reply which has been submitted.” Justice Naqvi then stated, “Look Abbasi respects the courts and is present today.”Bhutta in response said, “Nawaz did not appear today and this does not mean that he does not respect the courts.” The head of the three-judge bench then stated, “If Nawaz could not appear today for whatever reason, then you should have submitted a petition.”
Responding to the judge, Nawaz’s counsel said, “During the first hearing I got the impression that my client only has to appear once.”
At this, Justice Naqvi remarked, “It is fine that you got the wrong impression, but next time a petition should be submitted over failure to appear in court.”The hearing of the case was then adjourned till November 12
The Case
The petition, lodged by Advocate Azhar Siddiqui, alleges that Abbasi shared crucial details of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting with Nawaz following his statements on the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.
By leaking details of the NSC Abbasi committed high treason, the petition says.The petitioner had argued that Nawaz’s controversial interview to a newspaper had dented the country’s image and sovereignty. He further alleged that Abbasi supported Nawaz in the matter.
The petitioner further prayed upon the court to order a treason trial against the three respondents.
In July, the Lahore High Court had decided to adjourn the hearing till after the general elections.

He said that party leader Tariq Bashir Cheema had complains of meddling in his constituency.
Ilahi said that we have good relations with Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and good relations will continue in the future.
Prime Minister Imran Khan has appointed Chaudhry Sarwar as Punjab Governor, he added.
He said his colleague, Tariq Cheema, was merely raising a reservation in an internal meeting between coalition partners.
“If we do not discuss issues in our own homes, then where will we do it? If our member does not speak to us, then how will his reservations be addressed?” Elahi said.
Elahi said Cheema had a longstanding concern regarding interference in matters related to his constituency. “This is what he raised with Jehangir Tareen,” he said.
“The objective of such meetings is often to raise objections and resolve issues. PTI are our coalition partners. Reservations are raised and issues are resolved on a routine basis,” he said, adding: “You cannot stop anyone from interfering. But reservations can only be addressed if they are raised. This is common in every party and coalition.”
Speaking about the upcoming elections for vacant Senate seats, he said the PML-Q was supporting their coalition partners.
“About the Senate elections, the entire PTI leadership is involved, and our party is fully supporting Imran Khan’s party. We have supported them in the past and are supporting them in these elections as well,” he said.

We are moving forward with chief Minister Buzdar and supporting him and his party in every way,” he added.

In an exclusive video, Punjab assembly speaker Pervaiz Elahi is seen demanding former Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) parliamentarian Jahangir Tareen to control the Punjab Governor.
Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) member and federal Minister for Housing Tahir Bashir Cheema also backed the demand saying that Sarwar will not let Chief Minister (CM) Usman Buzdar run the provincial government.The video, which surfaced on Saturday, shows a meeting between Tareen, Punjab Minister for Mines and Minerals Hafiz Ammar Yasir, and PML-Q leaders Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and Federal Minister for Housing Tariq Bashir Cheema.
In the video, Cheema can be heard speaking to Tareen. “Sir, control Sarwar! He will not let your chief minister continue,” he tells Tareen in a candid manner.The video has raised questions over the how much authority PTI’s Usman Buzdar wields chief minister in the province.
Responding to a question over he video, Punjab Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan said the video and Cheema’s words were being taken “out of context”.
“The centre of power according to the law and Constitution is Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and the chief minister’s secretariat. A hundred percent of ministers stand with the chief minister and are working under his leadership,” he said.“There are apprehensions and reservations which were being conveyed to the leadership, which is what Tariq Cheema was doing during the meeting,” said Chohan, adding that needless hype should not be created around the statement.
He said that Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and other allies of the PTI were working with his party and Chief Minister Buzdar.
“There are differences in politics which are minor issues. Cheema was speaking on this [differences] which is not a big deal. This doesn’t mean that the chief minister is weak,” he said.

1114,Trump Limits Asylum From Mexico Border,https://abbtakk.tv/en/trump-limits-asylum-from-mexico-border/,"November 10, 2018","Washington (November 10, 2018): US president Donald Trump on Friday effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.
The order, which goes into effect on Saturday, means that migrants will have to present themselves at U.S. ports of entry to qualify for asylum. U.S. immigrant advocates rushed to court to try to block the policy.
“I just signed the proclamation on asylum – very important,” Trump told reporters on Friday before leaving for Paris. “People can come in but they have to come in through the points of entry.”Trump made his hard-line policies toward immigration a key issue ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. He has vowed to deploy troops at the border to stop a caravan of mainly Honduran migrants, currently edging their way through Mexico.
Several hundred of the caravan started north again on Friday after a rest in Mexico City. Many of them have said they want to seek asylum in the United States, citing violence in their own countries.
Trump’s proclamation said mass migration on the border had precipitated a crisis and he was acting to protect the national interest.
Trump’s proclamation does not apply to unaccompanied children, officials said.Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant advocacy groups filed suit Friday in the Northern District of California to block the Trump administration’s plan to deny asylum protections to migrants who cross the Mexico border illegally.
“The asylum ban is not justified by events on the ground, puts lives in danger and is patently unlawful,” said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney.
“The administration is flagrantly ignoring a federal statute and bypassing the most basic procedural requirements governing the issuance of new laws.”
Administration officials have anticipated the lawsuits, and the possibility that lower courts will side with the plaintiffs.

The decision was made in 30-member parliamentary committee formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToRs) for the impending probe into allegations of rigging during the 2018 elections held its opening session on Wednesday.
Khattak’s name for the chairperson’s role was proposed by PPP’s Naveed Qamar. After no one objected to it, the federal defence minister assumed the role unopposed.
However, the opposition and government’s representatives appeared to be at loggerheads over the name of the probe committee, with the former insisting that the name should mention a “rigging probe” but government members pointing out that the National Assembly resolution on the issue only talks about a “review”.After some deliberation, it was decided that the members should move forward from the impasse over what the committee should be called.
“The name of the committee is a trivial matter; we will settle it mutually,” Khattak told the media later on. “The [task] for this committee today was to elect a chairperson, which it did by choosing me.”
The former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM made it clear that “appointing a co-chairperson was out of the question. There will only be one chairperson.”
The committee today also formed a sub-committee to outline the ToRs for the committee that will prove or disprove alleged rigging in the 2018 polls.
The eight-member sub-committee, Khattak said, will make its recommendations within 15 days.

1119,"US Mid Term: Democrats Win House, Republicans Hold Senate",https://abbtakk.tv/en/us-mid-term-democrats-win-house-republicans-hold-senate/,"November 7, 2018","Washington (November 07, 2018): Democrats have taken back control of the House of Representatives but not won a majority in the Senate as the historic “blue wave” they hoped for failed to materialise at the midterm elections.
The achievement means that the Republicans no longer hold both wings of the US Congress, handing Donald Trump’s political opponents a stronger foothold in Washington from which to oppose his presidency.
The Democrats now have the numbers to veto Mr Trump’s proposed laws in the House and launch a string of damaging investigations into his administration through the committees they will control.
However in the Senate it was a different story, with Republicans unseating a string of Democratic senators up for re-election in states Mr Trump won in 2016. It indicates many of the president’s supporters are still with him two years into office.Projections suggested the Republicans could even increase their majority in the Senate, allowing them to push ahead with controversial judicial and cabinet appointments with less fear of rebellions. Mr Trump, quick to put his spin on a night of mixed results, tweeted: “Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: “Anybody that was anticipating a blue wave tonight is not going to get it.”
In some of the most closely watched races, Democrats lost out. Beto O’Rourke, who had become a pinup for American liberals by running a surprisingly competitive race in Texas, ultimately fell short, with Ted Cruz winning re-election as the state’s senator.
Andrew Gillum, the left-leaning Democrat who was hoping to become Florida’s first ever black governor, was also defeated, narrowly losing to Trump acolyte Ron DeSantis. A number of historic landmarks were reached, with the first Muslim congresswomen, first openly gay male governor and the youngest ever congresswoman (aged 29) all being elected.The story of the night was that of two different battles playing out – one for control of the House and another for the Senate. In the House races, all eyes were on America’s suburbs. Democrats quickly made gains but failed to pick off seats which would have indicated they were on course for a landslide.
One Republican senator close to Mr Trump, Lindsey Graham, admitted the party would have to address its “suburban women problem” as the Democrats gained seats. Their control of the House will be a huge headache for Mr Trump. His legislative agenda will grind to a hold, with the chances of securing new funding for his US-Mexico border or another tax cut significantly diminished.
The White House is also braced for Democrat-controlled House committees to launch many probes that could damage the president on everything from his tax returns to ties to Russia, using their power to order witnesses to testify. Nancy Pelosi, the woman expected to become the new Democrat Speaker of the House, said in a celebratory speech that Wednesday would be a “new day in America”, adding: “We’ve all had enough of division.”

1120,USA: For The First Time Muslim Women Elected To Congress,https://abbtakk.tv/en/american-for-the-first-time-muslim-women-elected-to-congress/,"November 7, 2018","Web Desk (November 7, 2018): Americans created history on Tuesday when they elected two Muslim women – Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib – to Congress.
Although Muslim men have been elected to Congress before, Ilhan and Rashida are the first Muslim women to represent Americans in the US House of Representatives. Ilhan, 37, was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, on October 4, 1981. In 2016, she was elected a Democratic Party member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, making her the first Somali-American legislator elected to a public office in the United States.A hijab-wearing mother of three, Ilhan is married to a Somali-American Ahmed Hirsi. She has a bachelor’s degree in politics from North Dakota State University and has also studied public affairs.
She won the Democratic primary on August 14, 2018, and contested the election on a party ticket.
Ilhan’s father, Nur Omar Mohamed, is a teacher trainer. Her mother died when Ilhan was a child and she was raised by her father and grandfather. After the start of the civil war in 1991, she and her family fled Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. In 1995, they emigrated to the United States, initially settling in Arlington, Virginia and then moving to Minneapolis.
Ilhan ran from Minnesota’s 5th district, a deeply Democratic area previously represented by a fellow Muslim, Keith Ellison, who won six terms from here.
She beat Republican Jennifer Zielinski to take Keith Ellison’s seat, which he vacated to run for Minnesota attorney general.
Rashida Tlaib:Technically, Palestinian-American Rashida Harbi Tlaib is the first American Muslim woman to be elected to Congress. Although her election was officially announced on Tuesday, she was elected unopposed as no one came forward to challenge Rashida in another deeply Democratic district.
Rashida, who is associated with a socialist group within the Democratic Party, is also very popular in this constituency.
On January 1, 2009, Rashida became the first Muslim American woman to serve in the Michigan Legislature, and the second Muslim woman in history to be elected to any US state legislature.
In 2018, she won the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 13th congressional district and won unopposed. She was born on July 24, 1976, to working-class Palestinian immigrants in Detroit and is the eldest of 14 children. Her parents were both born in Palestine.
Rashida played a major role in raising her siblings as her parents worked or relied on welfare are for support.
She graduated from Wayne State University with a BA in political science in 1998 and in 2004, she earned a law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.
Rashida is also the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress.

1128,Polling For Two Senate Seats From Punjab To Be Held on 15,https://abbtakk.tv/en/polling-for-two-senate-seats-from-punjab-to-be-held-on-15/,"November 4, 2018","Lahore (November 04, 2018): Polling for the two vacant seats of senate from Punjab will be held on 15th of November in Punjab Assembly.
The seats fell vacant due to disqualification of PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar Khan and Sadia Abbasi.
Earlier on October 25, the election commission had de-notified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi in the light of Supreme Court’s verdict in dual nationality case.On October 17, the Supreme Court disqualified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi for still holding dual nationalities at the time of filing their nomination papers for the upper house of the parliament.
Bilal Manto, who was assisting the SC in the case, said that whether or not a nationality could be completely renounced depends on that particular country’s laws.

Citing Canada as an example, Manto said that the Canadian law does not allow its citizens to give up its nationality altogether once it has been procured.
Following Manto’s argument, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar gave the orders of disqualification under Article 63 (1)(c) of the 1973 Constitution.During the hearing, Justice Nisar said that while the time of a person renouncing a nationality can be counted from the day they write to their respective embassy to relieve them of the second nationality, the letter should already be written at the time a candidate submits their nomination papers for a public office.
“This was not the case for Abbasi,” the chief justice observed.
The chief justice also told the counsels of Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and PML-N’s Nuzhat Sadiq to furnish their clients’ verified affidavits showing that they had given up their second nationalities before filing their nomination papers.

The election will take place on November 15.
Seeme Ezdi is close relative disqualified PTI leader Jahangir Khan Tareen.
Governor Punjab met the women candidate and congratulated her over the nomination. “I hope that she will highlight the plight of women in rural areas,” he added.
The seat fell vacant due to disqualification of Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader Saadia Abbasi due to dual nationality.Earlier on October 25, the election commission had de-notified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi in the light of Supreme Court’s verdict in dual nationality case.
On October 17, the Supreme Court disqualified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi for still holding dual nationalities at the time of filing their nomination papers for the upper house of the parliament.
Bilal Manto, who was assisting the SC in the case, said that whether or not a nationality could be completely renounced depends on that particular country’s laws.

Citing Canada as an example, Manto said that the Canadian law does not allow its citizens to give up its nationality altogether once it has been procured.
Following Manto’s argument, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar gave the orders of disqualification under Article 63 (1)(c) of the 1973 Constitution.During the hearing, Justice Nisar said that while the time of a person renouncing a nationality can be counted from the day they write to their respective embassy to relieve them of the second nationality, the letter should already be written at the time a candidate submits their nomination papers for a public office.
“This was not the case for Abbasi,” the chief justice observed.
The chief justice also told the counsels of Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and PML-N’s Nuzhat Sadiq to furnish their clients’ verified affidavits showing that they had given up their second nationalities before filing their nomination papers.

Are such statements given? There is a limit to irresponsibility.”“The information minister, who is a lawmaker, issued a statement that if an executive has to run the government then why were the elections held. Which institution was he digging at in his statement?” Justice Nisar asked.
The top judge continued, “The interior secretary was not aware that the prime minister also holds the portfolio of interior minister. Your minister says they will do as they please, we will see how he does this.”
“A cow entered Swati’s farmhouse, what was the big deal? Children were arrested and put behind bars and then on TV he stated that he will clarify his position,” Justice Nisar added.

Mohsin Khan aired his views about Sarfraz during an interview. “I have said it before and I will say it now too, with Sarfraz I was saying you got a new guy in and don’t put the burden of three formats on him.” “It will take such a physical load on him, T20s, ODIs and then Tests; if he is captain he will not get any mental relaxation.”
Khan further said, “Sarfraz’s body language was so down. I felt sorry for him that he’s had so much pressure put on him, with T20s, ODIs and Tests. There’s no doubt he is so talented and it’s not as if he is 35-36.”
“He is young, he has a lot of time. That was my view before and it is now as well,” he added. Earlier On October 26, the PCB announced a four-member special committee to oversee all cricketing matters in the country.
Former cricketer and selector Mohsin Khan has been named the chairman of the committee. Former captains Wasim Akram, Misbah-ul-Haq, Urooj Mumtaz are the other three members of the committee who will meet the chief selector and coach (men, women and junior teams) three times in a year, and review plans for the development of umpires, referees and curators.
The team management and the selection committee are unhappy with Khan’s comments about Sarfraz, according to the PCB sources.“It is incorrect to say such things about an in-form captain who just led the team to a Test series win against Australia,” the sources said.
“Before becoming the chairman Mohsin used unacceptable words for coach Mickey Arthur too,” the sources added.
“People were not taken into confidence over the appointment of the committee chairman,” the sources said, adding, “Chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq is not happy with the formation of the committee.”

In his constitutional petition, filed in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, Siddiqui stated that he was discriminately sacked on account of making a public speech.

The former IHC judge contended that he has been sacked without a proper inquiry to prove his claims in the speech he delivered at the Rawalpindi Bar Association.
He also alleged that the SJC order “suffered from various illegalities and malafides” and prayed to the apex court to set aside the notification and restore his position as IHC judge.
In his appeal, Siddiqui stated: “In view of the historical evolution of procedure for removal from high public office through an impeachment under the public gaze and open proceedings, the action against the petitioner [Siddiqui] is violative of rule of law and judgements of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.”
The former IHC judge also claimed that SJC members were biased against him, saying that his removal “in an illegal manner was part of [a] preconceived plan of the worthy chairman of the SJC who intended to deprive the petitioner judge [Siddiqui] from becoming the chief justice of [the] Islamabad High Court. A plan is now afoot to bring ‘his man’ as a chief justice of [the] Islamabad High Court This is itself sufficient ground to establish the malafide exercise of power by the Chairman.”Siddiqui pleaded the apex court to withdraw the notification of his removal and restore him as IHC judge.
President Arif Alvi had removed Siddiqui as judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council (SCJ) on October 11.
The decision was taken by five members of the SJC led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar. Other judges on the panel included: Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, Justice Gulzar Ahmad, Lahore High Court’s Chief Justice Yawar Ali and Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court Justice Ahmed Ali Sheikh.
Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who is senior most among SC judges, wrote in the 39-page report that Justice Siddiqui did not even spare the Supreme Court when he remarked that he knew who sent messages to the apex court and who delivered them.Such reckless and irresponsible conduct of a high court judge was “not countenanced by any standard of judicial propriety and the Code of Conduct in this country is no exception in that regard”, the report stated.
The SJC had unanimously opined that while delivering the speech before the District Bar Association in Rawalpindi on July 21, “Siddiqui, an IHC judge, displayed a conduct unbecoming of a high court judge”.
On July 20, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had made serious allegations against personnel of a security agency, claiming that they were manipulating judicial proceedings. He also claimed the agencies approached the IHC chief justice to ensure Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz remained behind bars for the elections.
On July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.
On Oct 11, a letter written by the SJC had emerged, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July. Later in the day, President Arif Alvi removed him. According to a statement, issued by the federal law ministry, the president took the decision after the SJC recommended his removal.

Ethiopian members of parliament have elected Sahle-Work Zewde as the country’s first female president.
Ms Sahle-Work is an experienced diplomat who has now become Africa’s only female head of state. Her election to the ceremonial position comes a week after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appointed a cabinet with half the posts taken up by women.
After being sworn in, President Sahle-Work promised to work hard to make gender equality a reality in Ethiopia. The new president was keen to make a point about gender equality right from the start, telling MPs that if they thought she was talking too much about women, she had only just begun.There may now be male-female parity in the new cabinet but elsewhere there is still a long way to go. Ms Sahle-Work’s appointment has been welcomed by Ethiopians on social media with many calling it “historic”.
She has been described as Ethiopia’s first female head of state of the modern era, with some remembering Empress Zewditu who governed the country in the early part of the 20th Century. Ms Sahle-Work was voted in after the unexpected resignation of her predecessor, Mulatu Teshome.
The prime minister’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, tweeted that “in a patriarchal society such as ours, the appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future but also normalises women as decision-makers in public life”. President Sahle-Work has served as an ambassador for Ethiopia in Senegal and Djibouti. She has also held a number of UN positions, including head of peace-building in the Central African Republic (CAR).
In a historic move, the two Houses has elected Ambassador Shalework Zewde as the next President of #Ethiopia. She is the first female head of state in modern Ethiopia. A career diplomat & senior official at the UN, she brings the right competence & experience to the office. (1)
— Fitsum Arega (@fitsumaregaa) October 25, 2018

Immediately before becoming president, Ms Sahle-Work was the UN representative at the African Union. In the Ethiopian constitution, the post of president is ceremonial with the prime minister holding the political power. The last African female head of state was Mauritian President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, who resigned in March over an expenses scandal. She denied any wrong doing.

On October 17, the Supreme Court disqualified PML-N senators Haroon Akhtar and Sadia Abbasi for still holding dual nationalities at the time of filing their nomination papers for the upper house of the parliament.
Bilal Manto, who was assisting the SC in the case, said that whether or not a nationality could be completely renounced depends on that particular country’s laws.

Citing Canada as an example, Manto said that the Canadian law does not allow its citizens to give up its nationality altogether once it has been procured.
Following Manto’s argument, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar gave the orders of disqualification under Article 63 (1)(c) of the 1973 Constitution.During the hearing, Justice Nisar said that while the time of a person renouncing a nationality can be counted from the day they write to their respective embassy to relieve them of the second nationality, the letter should already be written at the time a candidate submits their nomination papers for a public office.
“This was not the case for Abbasi,” the chief justice observed.
The chief justice also told the counsels of Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar and PML-N’s Nuzhat Sadiq to furnish their clients’ verified affidavits showing that they had given up their second nationalities before filing their nomination papers.

Both the sides agreed to further strengthen bilateral relations.
They also agreed to work together to achieve the common objectives in the region.
Earlier on October 22, the United States charge d’affaires in Pakistan called on Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa at the General Headquarters (GHQ), the head of the military’s media wing said in a tweet.
In the meeting, Ambassador Paul Jones and Gen Bajwa discussed matters of mutual interest, including regional security, “with [a] particular reference to Afghanistan”, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said.The meeting comes in the backdrop of a week of Taliban attacks and an election marred by violence in Afghanistan.
On Thursday last week, the Taliban had attack top Us and Afghan security chief inside a highly secure compound in Kandahar province.
A gunman wearing an Afghan security forces uniform opened fire on a group including General Scott Miller — the top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan — and powerful Afghan police chief General Abdul Raziq as they ended a meeting in the southern city of Kandahar.
Raziq, an anti-Taliban strongman and key US ally who was credited with keeping a lid on the insurgency in the south, was killed along with Kandahar’s provincial intelligence chief and an Afghan journalist. US Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Smiley was among those injured.

That the Taliban could mount a deadly insider assault in such a secure location rattled Afghanistan, a country long used to high-profile targeted killings and violence. It was also an unusual incident for the US military, whose generals seldom face attack and are rarely wounded.
The attack was followed by deadly violence during Afghanistan’s parliamentary elections.
The Taliban had vowed to attack the election, and on the first day of polling, at least 36 people were killed in nearly 200 attacks, including 27 civilians, according to Deputy Interior Minister Akhtar Mohammed Ibrahimi. He said security forces killed 31 insurgents in gun battles.
On Sunday, a roadside bomb in the eastern Nangarhar province struck a vehicle filled with civilians, killing 11 people, including six children.

1161,US General Wounded in Afghanistan Attack: Spokesman,https://abbtakk.tv/en/us-general-wounded-in-afghanistan-attack-military-spokesman/,"October 22, 2018","Kabul (October 22, 2018): A US army general was among those injured in a Taliban attack on top US and Afghan security chiefs inside a highly secure compound last week in Kandahar province, a military spokesman confirmed.
US Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Smiley, in charge of NATO’s military advisory mission in Afghanistan, suffered at least one gunshot wound in Thursday’s attack, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.
A gunman wearing an Afghan security forces uniform opened fire on a group including General Scott Miller — the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and powerful Afghan police chief General Abdul Raziq as they ended a meeting in the southern city of Kandahar.

Raziq, an anti-Taliban strongman and key US ally who was credited with keeping a lid on the insurgency in the south, was killed along with Kandahar’s provincial intelligence chief and an Afghan journalist.
Colonel David Butler, spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, initially confirmed on Twitter that three unidentified people were injured: one US service member, one US civilian and a coalition contractor.
Later, in tweets discussing US media reports that named Smiley, he confirmed he was wounded.
That the Taliban could mount a deadly insider assault in such a secure location rattled Afghanistan, a country long used to high-profile targeted killings and violence. It was also an unusual incident for the US military, whose generals seldom face attack and are rarely wounded.

Asif Disqualification Case,https://abbtakk.tv/en/sc-issues-detail-judgment-in-khawaja-asifs-disqualification-case/,"October 19, 2018","Islamabad (October 19, 2018): The Supreme Court has issued detailed judgement in the Khawaja Asif disqualification case stating that ‘neither a case of conflict of interest is made out nor has any wrongdoing associated with any asset belonging to the petitioner has been established’.
The Supreme Court on June 01 had set aside the verdict of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) disqualifying former foreign minister Khawaja Asif from the membership of parliament.

A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Umer Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Faisal Arab and Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, announced the verdict in the appeal filed by Khawaja Asif against his disqualification.
“Reasons to be recorded later on, we allow this petition and convert it into an appeal,” Justice Umer Ata Bandial announced a short order.
In its 22-page verdict, the SC observed that after going through the evidence on record “the petitioner (Kh Asif) cannot be labeled dishonest for omitting to declare such a small amount under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution.”
“……Right from the day the bank account was opened and till its closure, no business was transacted in the said account which substantiates the plea taken by the petitioner that non-disclosure was an innocent omission and not intended to conceal some wrongdoing. We are not oblivious of the fact that a bank account may reflect certain transactions of substantial value which have already taken place and scrutiny of such transactions may lead to disclosure of illegal financial dealings regardless of the meager amount lying deposited. However, that is not the case here as other than making a deposit of AED 5,000/- no transaction has taken place in the said account which throughout its life remained dormant,” the order read.Munir A Malik, counsel for Khawaja Asif, had contended that his client had mentioned all the necessary details in his nomination papers for the 2013 general elections. He submitted that his client had declared his bank accounts details and Iqama (work permit) before the writ was submitted by Usman Dar.
On April 26, the IHC had disqualified Khawaja Asif by declaring that he was not qualified to contest the General Election of 2013 from National Assembly constituency NA-110, Sialkot as he did not fulfil the conditions described under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution read with Section 99(1)(f) of the Representation of People’s Act (ROPA) 1976.
The PTI leader Usman Dar had filed a petition before the IHC, seeking disqualification of the PML-N leader for concealing his Iqama. Khawaja Asif however, had challenged in the Supreme Court his disqualification and had submitted that that there is no constitutional bar on employment of members of the National Assembly.

“If my inhibition isn’t wrong, it is the first time that the elected leader of the opposition has been arrested in such a manner and that even without any charge,” he continued.
“I won’t speak about the merit of the cases but I want to discuss the unholy alliance between the National Accountability Bureau and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),” Shehbaz said.
“PTI and NAB work closely,” he claimed while adding that the accountability bureau is targetting opposition parties.
Elaborating on his allegations, Shehbaz said, “Terrorism cases were filed against us on May 13 and NAB chairman has prepared my arrest orders between July 5-6. However, the decision to arrest me was implemented ahead of the by-polls.”He continued, “Sheikh Rasheed had said I will be put behind bars and there has to be a reason behind his statement.”
Speaking about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz’s arrest, Shehbaz said, “For the first time, a father was imprisoned in front of his daughter and a daughter in front of her father.”
Shehbaz added, “We expect the speaker to rise above likes and dislikes and to take action against intrusion in democracy.”
“As a public representative, Pakistani and a humble political worker I want to tell you [NA Speaker] that I have done nothing except for serving the people honestly,” he said and added that the Parliament will have to decide whether the “law of the jungle” will prevail.Delving into details regarding the Ashiana Housing Scheme, Shehbaz said, “It was alleged that I gave the contract to former army chief General (retd) Ashfaq Parvez Kayani’s brother to please him. However, I met Kamran Kayani for the first time in 2008. He had been awarded the contract by the Punjab government that was led by Pervez Elahi.”
“I did not go into the credentials of the contract as though it had to do with NAB or the previous government. However, when work was not being done I took up the matter with General (retd) Kayani who told me that I could cancel the contract if I pleased but I asked him to warn his younger brother instead.”“However, when I saw that Kamran was not listening to friendly advice I cancelled the contract,” Shehbaz said as opposition members broke into applause. “Till date, the former army chief has not questioned me regarding cancellation of his brother’s contract which goes on to show his integrity.”
“An inquiry under the supervision of then finance secretary Tariq Bajwa, who is the current governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), was carried out into the contract. I had forwarded the inquiry report to the anti-corruption department and had I not, then it could be alleged that I tried to protect Kamran Kayani,” Shehbaz thundered.
“I was given a notice in the Saaf Pani Case stating ‘come, we will make you have potable water’, but then I was told that I am being arrested in Ashiana Housing Scheme case. What is this joke?” he asked.“Is this tabdeeli that you snatch morsels from people,” he questioned. “This is not tabdeeli or Naya Pakistan but something else.”
“The NAB official told me that there is evidence that my children and I have investments in China and Turkey. To which, I hit the roof and told the officials to bring forward the evidence and I will apologise in Parliament,” he said while adding that they then stepped back and he warned the officials that this conversation is on record. “I told them you are involving our trusted friends in this low allegation,” he added. “Then, the officer blamed that the assets may be ‘benami’, I challenged this too. And they stepped back from it too.”
Questioning whether it is the “accountability bureau or blackmailing bureau,” Shehbaz once again spoke about the “unholy alliance between NAB and PTI” and said, “Imran Khan had levelled a similar allegation earlier and now NAB said it to me.”
“I have made mistakes but gave my blood and sweat for governance in Punjab,” he said.
The PML-N president continued, “I am the most ardent supporter of Pakistan-China and Pakistan-Saudi Arabia friendship but I will do anything to save every penny of this country and go to the last point to defend Pakistan’s interests.”“People say Punjab Speed and Shehbaz Speed but I say it is Godspeed and Pakistan Speed,” he said while speaking about projects with China.
He further said, “I was asked to testify against Khawaja Asif. To which I asked NAB officials if they have called me to issue statements against people and requested them to question me in the case that I have been taken in custody for. I have also complained to NAB director regarding this.”
“People are being asked to testify me and are being promised a big post in return,” he added.
“NAB has always been a silent spectator,” he said, “However, I have always raised my voice in my humble way and will continue doing so.”
Earlier on October 16, an accountability court in Lahor extended Shehbaz Sharif’s physical remand to the anti-graft watchdog for 14 days after his previous 10-day remand.

Sharif has been arrested on the charge that he tried to influence the transfer of a contract for the Ashiana Housing Scheme from one contractor to another.

“Officials in NAB were appointed by the previous governments and not even a sweeper in the bureau has been hired by us,” he added.
The information minister asserted, “Not even a single case against the Sharif brothers was initiated by us.”
Further, commenting on Shehbaz’s speech, Chaudhry said, “I was very glad that the opposition leader repeatedly said he will be ashamed and leave the Parliament if corruption is proven against him but I want to ask if the same rules apply on his brother.”
“I want to also clarify that cases against Shehbaz will not affect Pakistan and China’s relations,” he added while dismissing the PML-N president’s statements. “Today, our relations with UAE, China, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia are the strongest they have ever been and are continuing to gain strength.”He further commended the NA speaker for issuing Shehbaz’s production orders and said, “The government stands with the opposition on several matters.”
Earlier today, Pakistan Peoples Party leader, Syed Khursheed Shah has said that the debt has increased as soon as PTI assumed the power.
Addressing in National Assembly, Shah said the stock exchanged dropped from 52,000 points to 36,000 points and dollar is at an all-time high — it was never this high during PML-N or PPP’s terms. Why does nobody talk about inflation and the crumbling economy?”
“We gradually understood the importance of Parliament and the circumstances of the country are discussed here. Parliament forms laws for institutions,” Shah said.

Shah further said, “People are worried and the government is also fearful. When he [PM Imran] was in opposition he used to say that he should be hanged if he approached the International Monetary Fund.”
Stating that his political career spans over 30 years, Shah said, “There should be an investigation regarding where we have done this corruption that they [government] speaks of.”
“We do not know politics of hurling abuses,” he added. Earlier, PPP leader Khursheed Shah opposed Chaudhry taking to the floor and said it had been agreed that the government will respond towards the end of the session.

“If my inhibition isn’t wrong, it is the first time that the elected leader of the opposition has been arrested in such a manner and that even without any charge,” he continued.
“I won’t speak about the merit of the cases but I want to discuss the unholy alliance between the National Accountability Bureau and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),” Shehbaz said.
“PTI and NAB work closely,” he claimed while adding that the accountability bureau is targetting opposition parties.
Elaborating on his allegations, Shehbaz said, “Terrorism cases were filed against us on May 13 and NAB chairman has prepared my arrest orders between July 5-6. However, the decision to arrest me was implemented ahead of the by-polls.”He continued, “Sheikh Rasheed had said I will be put behind bars and there has to be a reason behind his statement.”
Speaking about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz’s arrest, Shehbaz said, “For the first time, a father was imprisoned in front of his daughter and a daughter in front of her father.”
Shehbaz added, “We expect the speaker to rise above likes and dislikes and to take action against intrusion in democracy.”
“As a public representative, Pakistani and a humble political worker I want to tell you [NA Speaker] that I have done nothing except for serving the people honestly,” he said and added that the Parliament will have to decide whether the “law of the jungle” will prevail.Delving into details regarding the Ashiana Housing Scheme, Shehbaz said, “It was alleged that I gave the contract to former army chief General (retd) Ashfaq Parvez Kayani’s brother to please him. However, I met Kamran Kayani for the first time in 2008. He had been awarded the contract by the Punjab government that was led by Pervez Elahi.”
“I did not go into the credentials of the contract as though it had to do with NAB or the previous government. However, when work was not being done I took up the matter with General (retd) Kayani who told me that I could cancel the contract if I pleased but I asked him to warn his younger brother instead.”“However, when I saw that Kamran was not listening to friendly advice I cancelled the contract,” Shehbaz said as opposition members broke into applause. “Till date, the former army chief has not questioned me regarding cancellation of his brother’s contract which goes on to show his integrity.”
“An inquiry under the supervision of then finance secretary Tariq Bajwa, who is the current governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), was carried out into the contract. I had forwarded the inquiry report to the anti-corruption department and had I not, then it could be alleged that I tried to protect Kamran Kayani,” Shehbaz thundered.
“I was given a notice in the Saaf Pani Case stating ‘come, we will make you have potable water’, but then I was told that I am being arrested in Ashiana Housing Scheme case. What is this joke?” he asked.“Is this tabdeeli that you snatch morsels from people,” he questioned. “This is not tabdeeli or Naya Pakistan but something else.”
“The NAB official told me that there is evidence that my children and I have investments in China and Turkey. To which, I hit the roof and told the officials to bring forward the evidence and I will apologise in Parliament,” he said while adding that they then stepped back and he warned the officials that this conversation is on record. “I told them you are involving our trusted friends in this low allegation,” he added. “Then, the officer blamed that the assets may be ‘benami’, I challenged this too. And they stepped back from it too.”
Questioning whether it is the “accountability bureau or blackmailing bureau,” Shehbaz once again spoke about the “unholy alliance between NAB and PTI” and said, “Imran Khan had levelled a similar allegation earlier and now NAB said it to me.”
“I have made mistakes but gave my blood and sweat for governance in Punjab,” he said.
The PML-N president continued, “I am the most ardent supporter of Pakistan-China and Pakistan-Saudi Arabia friendship but I will do anything to save every penny of this country and go to the last point to defend Pakistan’s interests.”“People say Punjab Speed and Shehbaz Speed but I say it is Godspeed and Pakistan Speed,” he said while speaking about projects with China.
He further said, “I was asked to testify against Khawaja Asif. To which I asked NAB officials if they have called me to issue statements against people and requested them to question me in the case that I have been taken in custody for. I have also complained to NAB director regarding this.”
“People are being asked to testify me and are being promised a big post in return,” he added.
“NAB has always been a silent spectator,” he said, “However, I have always raised my voice in my humble way and will continue doing so.”

The Council examined four complaints against Justice Kasi in a meeting chaired by the Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar on October 11. Kasi was accused of illegally appointing IHC officials.

“After detailed deliberations and discussion, the Council came to the conclusion that on the basis of material available on record no case of misconduct was made out against the honourable judge,” the press release reads.
“Therefore, the Supreme Judicial Council dismissed all the complaints against him.”
In September 2016, the SC had declared more than 70 appointments as illegal. In view of the SC judgment, Justice Iqbal Hameed ur Rehman resigned and a complaint was filed against Justice Kasi. The complaint remained pending for more than two years.The announcement comes a day after President Arif Alvi removed Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as a judge of the IHC under Article 209(5) on the SJC’s recommendation under Article 209(6) read with Article 48(1) of the Constitution.
The council had unanimously opined that while delivering the speech before the District Bar Association in Rawalpindi on July 21, Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, an IHC judge, displayed conduct unbecoming of a high court judge.The president took the decision after the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommended his removal, the statement added.
A letter written by the SJC had emerged earlier in the day, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July earlier this year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.
“The council is unanimously of the opinion that in the matter of making his speech before the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi on [July 21] Mr. Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui […] had displayed conduct unbecoming of a judge of a high court and was, thus, guilty of misconduct and he is, therefore, liable to be removed from his office under Article 209(6) of the Constitution,” the communication read.While addressing an audience at the bar, Justice Siddiqui had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.
He had further claimed that the spy agency had approached IHC Chief Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi and said: “‘We do not want to let Nawaz Sharif and his daughter come out [of the prison] until elections, do not include Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on the bench [hearing Sharifs’ appeals]’.”Justice Siddiqui had offered no evidence to support the claims he made.
The IHC judge was facing a reference over his controversial speech, the third reference filed against him.
Earlier on July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments at the Rawalpindi District Bar Association by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.
The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.
The council did not consider another request of Justice Siddiqui to hold the proceedings of this reference in the open court.The judge had been alrea­dy facing a reference on misconduct earlier moved on the complaint by some retired employees of the Capital Development Authori­ty (CDA) for alleged refurbishment of his official residence beyond entitlement.
Likewise, a similar show-cause notice was issued to Justice Siddiqui under Article 209 (5)(6) of the Constitution by the SJC on a reference moved by Advocate Kulsum Khaliq on behalf of former member of the National Asse­mbly Jamsh­ed Ahmed Dasti alleging that the high court judge had, during one of the hearings on a case relating to the 20-day Faizabad sit-in, objected to a compromise between the federal government and the protesting Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah.

Sattar regretted, “During the July 25 polls, MQM-P’s seats went from 17 to four and the upcoming by-polls will be the party’s next test.”
Stating that the MQM-P is in a “weak position right now”, Sattar demanded, “If you want to save the party from division and destruction, reinstate all members of the party as per the positions held by them on February 5.”
“The party is headed towards collapse and to save it from complete destruction, intra-party elections should be held as early as possible,” he further demanded.“To steer the party out of the current turmoil, a fresh mandate needs to be sought from workers,” Sattar added. “I will accept whatever the result of the intra-party election is.”
Sattar stepped back from party matters after he was not issued a ticket for the by-election.
He had also resigned from the party’s top decision-making body, Rabita Committee last month. The resignation had come in the backdrop of Sattar’s confirmation that he was consulting with his close friends over an offer he had received from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to join the party.Moreover, differences between Sattar and another leader of the party, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, had intensified prior to the General Elections 2018 held on July 25, following which MQM-P was split into two groups – Sattar’s PIB and Siddiqui’s Bahadurabad faction.
Sattar lost the NA-247 seat to PTI candidate Dr Arif Alvi during the elections. The seat is now up for the grab following the presidential election which saw Alvi being elected as the country’s 13th president.

“We understand that Pakistan has formally requested assistance from the IMF. As we do in all cases, we will examine closely all aspects, including Pakistan s debt position, in evaluating any loan program,” a State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said during briefing.

“This is something that we’ve been tracking fairly closely. The Secretary had spoken about this a few months back, I know, in some interviews not that long ago. I think part of the reason that Pakistan found itself in this situation is Chinese debt and the fact that there is debt that governments have incurred that they maybe thought wouldn’t be so tough to bail themselves out of, but has become increasingly tough. So – last question and then I’ve got to go,” she said.The US has the greatest influence in the IMF s decision-making process.
Earlier on October 11, International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde said Pakistan has formally requested for financial assistance.
In a statement, Lagarde said she met with Finance Minister Asad Umar, State Bank Governor Tariq Bajwa and members of their economic team. “During the meeting requested financial assistance from the IMF to help address Pakistan’s economic challenges,” Lagarde said in the statement.

IMF Chief said an IMF team will visit Islamabad in the coming weeks to initiate discussions for a possible IMF-supported economic programme.The formal request follows an apparent 7 per cent central bank devaluation of Pakistan’s rupee currency on Tuesday.
Earlier today, Lagarde said she would meet with Pakistani officials today with expectations that Islamabad will request a bailout of its shaky economy. “I’m assuming that there might be a programme request on their part, but that has not been discussed and we will explore that this afternoon,” she had told a press briefing.
Earlier, World Bank in its latest report predicted that the economic condition of Pakistan is likely to remain unstable for the next two years and it needs investment and productivity-driven growth.
World Bank country director Illango Patchamuthu has said that Pakistan’s growth has to be driven by investment and productivity which will put it on a path to end the boom and bust cycle its economy faces.

According to report, “This will create more and better paid jobs and is a reliable path to future economic growth and stability,” director said while commenting on the World Bank’s twice-a-year report Pakistan Development Update.
The report suggested Pakistan needs to address growing fiscal and current account deficits on a sustainable basis for long-term growth.The country’s economic growth accelerated to 5.8 percent in the 2018 financial year – the highest level in more than a decade, the report said.
But as consumption-led growth picked up, the macroeconomic imbalances also grew, increasing vulnerabilities that compromise future growth.
The fiscal deficit continued to expand, revenue mobilization weakened, and spending rose. On the external front, the current account deficit grew to 5.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product as the country faced the largest trade deficit ever.The report notes that exports rose, and imports slowed down in the second half of the year due to a more flexible exchange rate. It recommends the reduction in trade costs and improvements in the investment climate to enable Pakistan to compete in global markets.
Meanwhile the report also proposed a number of structural reforms in various sectors including Pakistan’s revenue sector.
“Revenue as a share of GDP continues to be very low and a large share of the revenue is
generated through indirect taxation,” it said.The tax system is highly complex, which increases compliance costs, thereby affecting the business environment. The fragmented tax administration between the federal government and the provinces also contributes to the complexity and often causes double taxation.
Needed reforms to domestic revenue mobilization include efforts to enhance the capacity of both federal and provincial authorities, legally binding coordination mechanisms, automated risk-based audit systems, improved compliance and enforcement, and making use of the available data on filers and non-filers, arrears management, and an independent appeals function.
Despite the political difficulties, the fragmentation of the tax base also needs to be addressed. Reforms, particularly as they relate to the need for improved coordination, could be supervised by a high-level constitutional body, such as the CCI.Earlier on October 10, Finance Minister Asad Umar held a meeting with the President of World Bank, Dr. Jim Yong Kim on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF Group Annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia.
In the meeting, the current level of Pak-World Bank cooperation was reviewed.
The Finance Minister shared with the World Bank leader, the vision of the new government and its priorities.
Asad Umar also held a number of meetings on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF Group Annual meetings.
He also met with his Indonesian counterpart Sri Mulyani Indrawati and discussed matters pertaining to expansion of bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
Finance Minister Umar emphasized expanding Pak-Indonesia trade relations.The Minister in this regard called upon the Indonesian side to expedite the process of ratification of the additional tariff lines granted to Pakistan after comprehensive review of the PTA in 2017.
Congratulating the Finance Minister on assuming the office after recent elections in Pakistan, Sri Mulyani Indrawati reaffirmed Indonesia’s desire to expand bilateral relations and assured her support to address the points raised by the Pakistan side.
The Minister also had meetings with senior officials of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and OECD.
Over 15,000 delegates from 189 countries are currently gathered at Bali, Indonesia for IMF/WB Group Annual meetings from 10-14 October 2018.

A letter written by the SJC had emerged earlier in the day, in which the council, comprising five Supreme Court judges, had said it found Justice Siddiqui guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July earlier this year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.“The council is unanimously of the opinion that in the matter of making his speech before the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi on [July 21] Mr. Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui […] had displayed conduct unbecoming of a judge of a high court and was, thus, guilty of misconduct and he is, therefore, liable to be removed from his office under Article 209(6) of the Constitution,” the communication read.
While addressing an audience at the bar, Justice Siddiqui had claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.
He had further claimed that the spy agency had approached IHC Chief Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi and said: “‘We do not want to let Nawaz Sharif and his daughter come out [of the prison] until elections, do not include Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on the bench [hearing Sharifs’ appeals]’.”
Justice Siddiqui had offered no evidence to support the claims he made.The IHC judge was facing a reference over his controversial speech, the third reference filed against him.
On July 31, the SJC had issued a show-cause notice to Justice Siddiqui on the reference for making unnecessary and unwarranted comments at the Rawalpindi District Bar Association by accusing the establishment of manipulating the judicial proceedings.
The SJC took up the matter after considering that such comments prima facie had the tendency of undermining the respect otherwise due to such constitutional institutions.
The council did not consider another request of Justice Siddiqui to hold the proceedings of this reference in the open court.
The judge had been alrea­dy facing a reference on misconduct earlier moved on the complaint by some retired employees of the Capital Development Authori­ty (CDA) for alleged refurbishment of his official residence beyond entitlement.
Likewise, a similar show-cause notice was issued to Justice Siddiqui under Article 209 (5)(6) of the Constitution by the SJC on a reference moved by Advocate Kulsum Khaliq on behalf of former member of the National Asse­mbly Jamsh­ed Ahmed Dasti alleging that the high court judge had, during one of the hearings on a case relating to the 20-day Faizabad sit-in, objected to a compromise between the federal government and the protesting Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah. The compromise was facilitated by the armed forces.
After scrutinising the reference, a meeting of the SJC held on Feb 6 observed that the judge was guilty of misconduct and should be issued a show-cause notice in this regard.

1236,"Opposition Mock NA Session Condemns Govt, NAB",https://abbtakk.tv/en/opposition-mock-na-session-condemns-govt-nab/,"October 11, 2018","Islamabad (October 11, 2018): The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), accompanied by parliamentarians from other opposition parties, on Thursday held a “mock National Assembly session” outside the Parliament House to protest the arrest of Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif.
The mock session has approved seven resolutions condemning NAB action and arrest of opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif.

The resolutions termed the allegations on Shehbaz Sharif baseless and act of revenge, condemned NAB for causing the loss of Rs 2800 billion to the national exchequer, making CPEC controversial and accepting of IMF hard conditions for the loan.
Chanting “shame, shame”, members of the alliance led by former National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq gathered outside the Parliament House and protested the arrest of the younger Sharif brother and the National Assembly’s failure to summon a session on the matter. PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah, addressing the protest, said there were no corruption allegations against Shehbaz Sharif. “Yet still, he was arrested but Babar Awan, [who is involved in corruption] and the biggest dacoit in Punjab Pervez Elahi have not been arrested,” he lamented.
If political victimisation is not ended, we will take the protest beyond the Parliament, Sanaullah warned.
Another PML-N leader Asif Kirmani claimed that the opponents were scared about by-elections and therefore, Shehbaz Sharif was arrested.
Members of opposition parties gathered in great numbers outside Parliament House, with some of them holding placards with anti-government slogans written on them. Former NA speaker Ayaz Sadiq chaired the mock session, in which a ‘call to attention’ notice was also presented regarding the arrest of Shahbaz Sharif.Earlier this week, the PML-N had demanded that Shahbaz Sharif, who is currently in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) custody, should be brought to parliament so he can present his case before the people of the country.
Sharif has been arrested on the charge that he tried to influence the transfer of a contract for the Ashiana Housing Scheme from one contractor to another.
On Wednesday, NA Speaker Asad Qaiser issued directives to convene the session requested by opposition parties on October 17. Additionally, the NA Secretariat also issued production orders to ensure the presence of Shahbaz Sharif for that session.
The opposition parties, however, were adamant they would protest outside Parliament House, saying the NA Speaker had not accepted their demand for an NA session this week.
While addressing the mock session, PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain said that Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were put behind bars ahead of the general elections and now they have arrested Shahbaz Sharif ahead of the by-polls.

He sought to allay concerns regarding an impending economic meltdown in the country, saying he will take the country out of this “difficult time”.
He said that his government is trying hard to stable govt institutions.
Khan said he will present a roadmap before the nation listing steps the government will take to stabilize the economy.
The premier said he will “guide” the nation every week on his government’s economic plans.
“Have courage, there is nothing to worry about,” the prime minister said, assuring the nation that the turbulence in the economy won’t last long.Khan said that an impression has been created in the last 48 hours “as if the sky is going to fall [or] the day of judgement is upon us”, but instead sought to explain the issues faced by the economy.
He said the previous governments had taken loans recklessly, which has resulted in the country’s debt ballooning from $6 trillion to $30 trillion in the past 10 years alone.
He said that the previous PML-N government had started its term with a $3 billion current account deficit, but the 40-day-old Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government inherited an $18bn current account deficit.
“One country wants to invest USD20 in the housing industry in Pakistan,” Prime Minister Khan said.“Inshahullah, we will steer Pakistan out of crises. It’s a difficult time for us but this too will phase soon,” he said.
The prime minister said that he would devise a roadmap to address the challenges being faced by the country.
“The housing scheme is our real scheme. At least 40 industries are directly related with the housing scheme. When we launch the project, all these industries will benefit from it,” he said.
“Our target is to build five million affordable houses in five years. Only ordinary people will benefit from this scheme,” Khan said.“A common man who can never think of owning his house is our target. And our second target is to provide employment opportunities to our jobless youth,” he said, adding that 40 industries were directly linked with the housing project.
“We will encourage youth to set up their own construction companies to be part of this initiative,” the premier said.
Khan said that skill development program would also be launched to help youth benefit from the project.
The prime minister noted that 80 percent of American population build their homes through loans.
Last month PM Imran had announced he will take ownership of the initiative in order to ensure smooth implementation and remove any administrative bottlenecks.
“Provision of five million houses equipped with all basic facilities, and regularisation of slums is the foremost priority of the government and a part of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s manifesto,” PM Imran said.
Earlier, the decision to build five million houses was taken in a meeting chaired by the prime minister Imran Khan on October 5.

1239,Pakistan’s Economy To Remain Unstable For Two Years: WB,https://abbtakk.tv/en/pakistan-is-in-grip-of-weak-economy-world-bank/,"October 11, 2018","Web Desk (October 11, 2018): The new report of World Bank has predicted that economic condition of Pakistan is likely to remain unstable for the next two years and it needs investment and productivity-driven growth.
World Bank country director Illango Patchamuthu has said that Pakistan’s growth has to be driven by investment and productivity which will put it on a path to end the boom and bust cycle its economy faces.

According to report, “This will create more and better paid jobs and is a reliable path to future economic growth and stability,” director said while commenting on the World Bank’s twice-a-year report Pakistan Development Update.
The report suggested Pakistan needs to address growing fiscal and current account deficits on a sustainable basis for long-term growth.The country’s economic growth accelerated to 5.8 percent in the 2018 financial year – the highest level in more than a decade, the report said.
But as consumption-led growth picked up, the macroeconomic imbalances also grew, increasing vulnerabilities that compromise future growth.
The fiscal deficit continued to expand, revenue mobilization weakened, and spending rose. On the external front, the current account deficit grew to 5.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product as the country faced the largest trade deficit ever.The report notes that exports rose, and imports slowed down in the second half of the year due to a more flexible exchange rate. It recommends the reduction in trade costs and improvements in the investment climate to enable Pakistan to compete in global markets.
Meanwhile the report also proposed a number of structural reforms in various sectors including Pakistan’s revenue sector.
“Revenue as a share of GDP continues to be very low and a large share of the revenue is
generated through indirect taxation,” it said.The tax system is highly complex, which increases compliance costs, thereby affecting the business environment. The fragmented tax administration between the federal government and the provinces also contributes to the complexity and often causes double taxation.
Needed reforms to domestic revenue mobilization include efforts to enhance the capacity of both federal and provincial authorities, legally binding coordination mechanisms, automated risk-based audit systems, improved compliance and enforcement, and making use of the available data on filers and non-filers, arrears management, and an independent appeals function.
Despite the political difficulties, the fragmentation of the tax base also needs to be addressed. Reforms, particularly as they relate to the need for improved coordination, could be supervised by a high-level constitutional body, such as the CCI.Earlier on October 10, Finance Minister Asad Umar held a meeting with the President of World Bank, Dr. Jim Yong Kim on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF Group Annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia.

Members said Riyadh can defend national security and its interests.
According to Arab tv, cabinet meeting took place in Riyadh under the chair by King Salman. Cabinet members praised crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman interview, given to American Tv.
During an interview to Bloomberg, Prince Muhammad said, Riyadh has the power to protect its territory and interest. We will not pay a single riyal for national security to anyone.Media Minister Awwad bin Saleh Al-Awwad said after the session that the Cabinet reviewed reports on the latest regional and international developments and events.
“Saudi Arabia provided over the past eight years $1.03 billion in humanitarian assistance to refugees around the world, $239.7 million in assistance through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and $93.2 million through the International Organization for Migration (IOM),” he added.The Cabinet condemned a suicide attack that targeted an election rally in eastern Afghanistan, and a terrorist attack that targeted a military convoy in southeast Turkey, killing and injuring dozens.
Earlier on October 06, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said: “Actually we will pay nothing for our security.” The Kingdom pays for all its military equipment from the US, he said.  “We believe that all the armaments we have from the United States of America are paid for, it’s not free armament.”

The crown prince said relations with the US are still strong despite comments by Donald Trump that the Kingdom must pay for American military support.
Since the beginning of Saudi-US relations “we’ve bought everything with money,” the crown prince told a group of reporters on Wednesday.Saudi Arabia changed its military spending strategy after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, with 60% of spending with the US over a decade, the prince said.
“That’s why we’ve created the $400 billion in opportunities, armaments and investment opportunities, and other trade opportunities,” which Prince Mohammed said was a good achievement for both countries.
The various deals, which were signed in 2017 when President Trump made Saudi Arabia his first overseas visit, means that “part of these armaments will be manufactured in Saudi Arabia, so it will create jobs in America and Saudi Arabia, good trade, good benefits for both countries and also good economic growth. Plus, it will help our security,” he said.President Trump and King Salman launched a global counter-terror center in Riyadh during his visit to the country.
Prince Mohammed visited Washington in March where the president hailed the links between the two allies. “The relationship is probably the strongest it’s ever been,” Trump said at a joint press conference.
“We have huge investments between both countries. We have good improvement in our trade – a lot of achievements, so this is really great,” the prince said on Wednesday.
The US-Saudi efforts, along with global partners, have pushed back extremists and terrorists and countered Iran’s “negative moves in the Middle East in a good way,” he told the journalists.On the topic of controlling oil prices, the crown prince said the Kingdom has never “decided that this is the right or wrong oil price. The oil price depends on trade – consumer and supplier – and they decide the oil price based on trade and supply and demand.
What we are committed in Saudi Arabia is to make sure there is no shortage of supply. So we work with our allies in OPEC and also non-OPEC countries to be sure that we have a sustainable supply of oil and there is no shortage and that there is good demand, that it will not create problems for the consumers and their plans and development,” he said.
Prince Mohammed confirmed that Trump did make a request to Saudi Arabia and OPEC to replace whatever may be lost of supply from Iran. “And that happened.  Because recently, Iran reduced their exports by 700,000 barrels a day, if I’m not mistaken. And Saudi Arabia and OPEC and non-OPEC countries, they’ve produced 1.5 million barrels a day. So we export as much as 2 barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently. So we did our job and more.We believe the higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran. It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada, and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela and other countries that moved the price a little bit higher. But Iran, definitely no. Because they reduced 700,000 barrels and we’ve exported more than 1.5 million barrels a day,” the crown prince said.
Earlier on October 03, Trump warned the Saudi ruler that he might not survive without US support.
President Trump claims he once warned Saudi Arabia’s King Salman that he wouldn’t last in power without help from the U.S. Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We protect Saudi Arabia… And I love the king, King Salman. But I said, ‘King, we’re protecting you, you might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military.’”He did not say when he issued the warning, but the two had a phone conversation on Saturday in which they discussed oil-market stability and global economic growth, according to Saudi media.
The president complained about the U.S. supposedly “subsidizing” Saudi Arabia’s military at a rally in West Virginia that same day.

“The prime minister has said he will get 50 people arrested. Who has given him the authority to do so?” asked Nawaz.
The former premier further accused the government of exacting political revenge. “The country’s stability is being affected due to proceedings aimed at exacting political revenge,” he said, claiming that nobody was politically victimised during Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) tenure.
“All laws formed under Musharraf’s tenure should be reviewed. We should get rid of notorious laws,” Nawaz remarked. Speaking about PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif’s arrest by NAB, Nawaz said the former Punjab chief minister served the country day and night and even fell ill due to excessive work.
“Pakistanis and foreigners alike praise Shehbaz’s work. Those who accused him were embarrassed after the Chinese government clarified the allegations,” he said.
Nawaz said that no one in Pakistan will be found ‘clean’ if assets cases are initiated against them.   Earlier on October 05, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif reacted to the arrest of his brother Shehbaz Sharif, terming it “worst victimization” and holding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government responsible for it.
The former premier, in his statement, said that not only the arrest was regretful, but it was ridiculous as well.
“Shehbaz, being the chief minister of Punjab, set an example of public service with honesty,” Nawaz said, noting, “His services were acknowledged by the people, foreign governments and international organisations.”

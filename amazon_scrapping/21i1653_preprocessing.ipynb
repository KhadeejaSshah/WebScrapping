They fit me above the knee, but not too high up where they look like short-shorts. The pockets are deep enough to help keep your items from falling out. Also, I notice they have a YKK brand zipper, which are sturdy, and don\\'t de-rail. I don\\'t see them much anymore, so I was pleasantly surprised with that quality of craftsmanship. Finally, these shorts have a nice, simple label with the waist size, and another one with the style \"e.g., slim\" which I find helpful in case I was to re-buy this or a similar product.'},\n",

This year I decided to buy them in the 9\" inseam, and I am not sure what happened, but they do not fit the same. I bought the same size as the 7\" and they were too tight, so I returned and bought a larger size and they still fit different not to tight but to lose. Legs were too wide on bigger pair, I have lost weight not gained from last year and the shorts from last year that are 7\" still fit fine, same style, same material, same size, just length is different so not sure what happened here. I love the 7\" inseam and own many pairs in many different colors, they look great and have held up well. The other thing I find with these is sometimes you might get a pair that fit better, and another pair that don\\'t even come close to fitting, even though they are the same size. The colors are great and are pretty true to what you see. They are nice looking shorts, comfortable, good material, just the 9\" inseam is not a good fit for me, so I returned.'},\n",

       "'I am 5\\'7\"-5\\'8\", about 185 lbs. These shorts fit me just right, but if I were to gain 5-10 extra lbs, I would have to go up in waist size.\\n\\nThese shorts have an excellent \"fit.\" The length is perfect for me. They fit me above the knee, but not too high up where they look like short-shorts. The pockets are deep enough to help keep your items from falling out. Also, I notice they have a YKK brand zipper, which are sturdy, and don\\'t de-rail. I don\\'t see them much anymore, so I was pleasantly surprised with that quality of craftsmanship. Finally, these shorts have a nice, simple label with the waist size, and another one with the style \"e.g., slim\" which I find helpful in case I was to re-buy this or a similar product., It’s okay, Nothing fancy, comforting to wear, inexpensive , wearing this for few days inside my home ,Fits well for me\\nSo far I like it ., Runs a couple sizes too small. So beware of that. Good looking shorts but make sure to size up if you’ve got that sexy dad bod., Very good quality and it fits me perfectly. Will order more. 👏👏, These shorts are great! They’re just right in how they fit. They don’t feel too heavy nor too thin they feel perfect. I’ve been on a few walks and they have been comfortable., Last Year I bought these shorts in the 7\" inseam, and they were great. This year I decided to buy them in the 9\" inseam, and I am not sure what happened, but they do not fit the same. I bought the same size as the 7\" and they were too tight, so I returned and bought a larger size and they still fit different not to tight but to lose. Legs were too wide on bigger pair, I have lost weight not gained from last year and the shorts from last year that are 7\" still fit fine, same style, same material, same size, just length is different so not sure what happened here. I love the 7\" inseam and own many pairs in many different colors, they look great and have held up well. The other thing I find with these is sometimes you might get a pair that fit better, and another pair that don\\'t even come close to fitting, even though they are the same size. The colors are great and are pretty true to what you see. They are nice looking shorts, comfortable, good material, just the 9\" inseam is not a good fit for me, so I returned., I was looking for good quality dressier shirts and these fit the bill very well., I really liked these shorts because they are made of cotton and the color is the same as the photo. I am size 36 in pants and it fits perfectly. I don\\'t think it\\'s a slim fit, my legs aren\\'t very thick and it was a little wide. I\\'m 5\\'10\" tall and weigh 170 lbs with a bit of a belly., I normally buy shorts on sale at local store, but I wanted the black so I had to buy from Amazon. The price is just ok, maybe on the high side, if they have a Prime day I would buy more., Nice shorts but the print images are nowhere near as clear as shown. You can hardly see the pineapples and looks dirty at first glance, Muy fresco para usar, cómodo, es un poco más ancho en las piernas que otros pero sigue siendo bueno, Accurate fit, comfortable and nice casual wear., Exelente para verano o tan solo trabajo, exelente tela y ajuste., na, brand name as good as just brand Amazon, Good, Good quality, They were very sturdy material looked great., They could’ve been just a little bit longer, but they are very stylish and the material is very sturdy material and they look really nice, Perfect.'"

       "'I am 5\\'7\"-5\\'8\", about 185 lbs. These shorts fit me just right, but if I were to gain 5-10 extra lbs, I would have to go up in waist size.\\n\\nThese shorts have an excellent \"fit.\" The length is perfect for me. They fit me above the knee, but not too high up where they look like short-shorts. The pockets are deep enough to help keep your items from falling out. Also, I notice they have a YKK brand zipper, which are sturdy, and don\\'t de-rail. I don\\'t see them much anymore, so I was pleasantly surprised with that quality of craftsmanship. Finally, these shorts have a nice, simple label with the waist size, and another one with the style \"e.g., slim\" which I find helpful in case I was to re-buy this or a similar product., It’s okay, Nothing fancy, comforting to wear, inexpensive , wearing this for few days inside my home ,Fits well for me\\nSo far I like it ., Runs a couple sizes too small. So beware of that. Good looking shorts but make sure to size up if you’ve got that sexy dad bod., Very good quality and it fits me perfectly. Will order more. 👏👏, These shorts are great! They’re just right in how they fit. They don’t feel too heavy nor too thin they feel perfect. I’ve been on a few walks and they have been comfortable., Last Year I bought these shorts in the 7\" inseam, and they were great. This year I decided to buy them in the 9\" inseam, and I am not sure what happened, but they do not fit the same. I bought the same size as the 7\" and they were too tight, so I returned and bought a larger size and they still fit different not to tight but to lose. Legs were too wide on bigger pair, I have lost weight not gained from last year and the shorts from last year that are 7\" still fit fine, same style, same material, same size, just length is different so not sure what happened here. I love the 7\" inseam and own many pairs in many different colors, they look great and have held up well. The other thing I find with these is sometimes you might get a pair that fit better, and another pair that don\\'t even come close to fitting, even though they are the same size. The colors are great and are pretty true to what you see. They are nice looking shorts, comfortable, good material, just the 9\" inseam is not a good fit for me, so I returned., I was looking for good quality dressier shirts and these fit the bill very well., I really liked these shorts because they are made of cotton and the color is the same as the photo. I am size 36 in pants and it fits perfectly. I don\\'t think it\\'s a slim fit, my legs aren\\'t very thick and it was a little wide. I\\'m 5\\'10\" tall and weigh 170 lbs with a bit of a belly., I normally buy shorts on sale at local store, but I wanted the black so I had to buy from Amazon. The price is just ok, maybe on the high side, if they have a Prime day I would buy more., Nice shorts but the print images are nowhere near as clear as shown. You can hardly see the pineapples and looks dirty at first glance, Muy fresco para usar, cómodo, es un poco más ancho en las piernas que otros pero sigue siendo bueno, Accurate fit, comfortable and nice casual wear., Exelente para verano o tan solo trabajo, exelente tela y ajuste., na, brand name as good as just brand Amazon, Good, Good quality, They were very sturdy material looked great., They could’ve been just a little bit longer, but they are very stylish and the material is very sturdy material and they look really nice, Perfect.'"

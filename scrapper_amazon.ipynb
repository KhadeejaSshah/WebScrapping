Secondly, the pants are well made, last a long time and are super comfy. They are generously sized so as a size 6 a small fits perfect. Last, I would say they are between regular pants and sweats…comfy but do not look like sweats so are OK to wear out and about.

I literally have to pull the waste of these pants to under my ribcage in order not to step on the bottoms or drag them across the floor. My opinion? The legs are also too loose, the overall look sloppy while wearing them. The logo is at the bottom of the left leg. To cut them to a desirable length is not an option. Length factors into the lack of comfort, otherwise they are comfortable enough due to the given description of the material. They're lightweight cotton, therefore stretch is not a consideration. Unfortunately, I would not purchase these pants again. \n",

      "Review Text: I'm 5'8 and have big lymphedema legs and these are soft, comfy and fit well. Not tool clingy , not too hot and sweaty. Thin but warm enough to wear in winter to the gym. I'm a tall woman and these are an inch or two too long but I can just hike the waist up and tie the strings they felt like they will stay in place just fine. I'm just grateful for wide leg and soft pants to wear. Pretty good, wish they would restock black as I'd rather have those than grey but overall satisfied with the 23 dollar price point. \n",

      "Review Text: For reference i’m 5’1, 107 lbs and It’s always so hard to find pants that fit my short legs and also don’t ride up. I purchased the Small 29” inseam and they fit perfectly. They just barely touch the ground without shoes, so flats or small 1 inch heels work with these pants. I can wear these as yoga pants, casual wear, or dressy. Unfortunately, the material is a lint magnet so be prepared to lint brush. I love them so much the lint factor isn’t a big deal. There is tummy control so it goes just below my belly button. Also there’s a lot of stretch to it. Hope this helps! \n",

I ordered the size Large in these sweats. When they arrived I put them on and maybe an inch past the heel of my foot and loose fit, but not bad. Then I immediately washed them in HOT (my hot is very hot) and dried them on HOT. They came out perfect. Hem was right at floor level and the fit was great. They're sweats, I like my sweats a little loose. That said, the medium would have been too body hugging for me; I personally don't want to see my panty lines when in lounge wear.

Love, love the pants as they are well constructed, with good material and even stitching, and as they are soft inside, warm, but not hot, feel very comfortable, and look cute.

Good is that after having been worn twice they dropped a little and are now the perfect length for me. Not so good is that the joggers stretch with movements, and with no recovery to the material, become out of shape and remain loose. You'd need to be wearing a new pair if traveling or going somewhere special, as their well-fitted look morphs into a comfy but sloppy type of \"wear at home\" look. These joggers still earn my 4-star rating for home use due to their comfort & warmth. I have a 2nd pair which I am saving for Christmas day as temps will be below freezing. Hopefully they will look good for the length of the family get-together.

These were warm enough to wear around the house on a cold winter day (we keep our heater at 68*F) yet still warm enough to go outside to take out the trash, grab something from the car, walk into a store, etc. The material reminds me of how I would describe a classic sweat pant - think old-school Champion brand style.\n",

And I have to give Amazon a huge shout out for making the decision to manufacture in a country other then China and still at a steller price point! I did order a small which is my usual size and as you can see the waist line is quiet roomy. I'd said a bit too much but again, it is a drawstring tie so it works. I'm 26\" in my waist so that may help you pick what size will work best for you. I think the only con for me really are the pockets. Overall a great size but the opening is a bite wide and the pockets are not super deep so there is a chance depending on the phone you have, it may slip out of you bend over or squat down. \n",

However, the length ended up being almost exactly right. The waist is a smidge too big as well, but I would rather have them too big - just in case they shrink in the dryer. The reason for four stars instead of five is because there is about a two inch space on the right leg where the seam isn't sewn.

The waist comes just over my belly button, so they're not super high-waisted (which I don't like), but they have a wide waistband that stays in place and helps smooth my tummy. They don't create muffin-top, they don't roll over or slide down, and they aren't see-through (I was concerned about the light blue, but they're fine). I wash them in cold and hang them to dry, and they do great (they also dry quickly, which is great for travel).\n",

I love my Lululemons because they are the only leggings I've found that are comfortable and really stay in place, but these are almost as nice and only half the price.

      "Review Text:  I got these when the price dropped on Amazon down to like $11 for the 8 pack in the blue colorway. I ordered these for my 10 yr old daughter. She wears a girls size 5.5 shoe which I think translates to a woman’s 5-5.5 or 6. Something like that. Girls socks in the kids section were pretty tight and small on her so using the size chart on here, I decide to buy these in a woman’s size S for her. They fit her perfectly. She likes the little cushioned tab at the back of the ankle. I purchased these with a 6 pack of puma socks which you can see in my video as well. The puma socks msrp for $18 but I paid less than $9 because Amazon had them marked down. The puma socks are actually a little bit thicker than these Saucony ones and they seem to be a little bit better made. The Saucony socks have some messy, loose threading that were stitched a little sloppily, but nothing to get all up in arms about. Even despite the messy threads being stitched into the seams, they are stitched together pretty well and seem like they will hold together well. I like that they are blue/darker colored which will definitely hide the wear & tear better than a traditional white sock. I will update my review after they get washed and get some mileage out on them 😊 \n",

I like my socks to feel smooth and to cling to my feet without feeling tight -- or as I said, \"squeeezy\". Another plus is that my shoe size is women''s 12, and even the largest women's socks tend to be stretched to the max to fit my feet, so I've had to wear men's socks that only come in white, black, or gray. By contrast, these Saucony socks have women's sizes large enough to fit comfortably and the colors are pretty, too. I highly recommend these socks. \n",

Maybe the fabric changed...or maybe some colors are different...but the two shirts I received are buttery soft, almost a marshmallow texture, and not shiny at all. What's more, the fit is amazing! Not the tiny \"women's sizes\" of some brands (who must think we're all 13 years old). These have the same sizing as other women's shirts and blouses. If you wear a large in other tops, order a large! They also have a very slightly fitted shape so they skim over the hips without stretching or being big and boxy through the waist. (The large is about two inches wider around the bottom hem than at the bust.) I also love the length--not cropped, not a tunic. They hit about mid-hip. Well done, Amazon Essentials! For reference, I ordered black heather/navy heather in June 2023, and I'm back to order some more! \n",

The material is comfortable and better for me than a cotton T-shirt so no problem and I will keep it. I am 5'2 and 128 lbs. Hoping to lose weight and be 115 lbs soon. The shirt will be a bit loose when I get to that weight but for now, it fits me like a glove with room to spare. The medium had a loose neckline and fit me rather baggy. So make sure to size down as I usually am a medium and this shirt kind of surprised me as I rarely wear a small-sized shirt being 128 and sometimes weighing up to 131 lbs. So do your homework. The return was easy since I am a prime customer and only buy prime products. \n",

      "Size & Fit: I’m 210 & 5’9” and have a large chest. I ordered XXL. They fit exactly like the GAP favorite tees or the old Mossimo tees from Target. XXL gives enough room for the chest without bulking out in the midsection. I don’t like t shirts that cram into my armpits and these don’t do that; so another plus. They’re long enough for me which is to say they’re not a tunic but they’re not cropped or short like every woman’s exercise tee seems to be now. They sit like a cute t shirt, not like a unisex or men’s t shirt.\n",

I hang my shirts to dry but these probably will never shrink or fall apart because of what they are made out of. I bought the 6X because I wasn't sure how well they would fit compared to the other Amazon shirts I have gotten recently. I really wish that sizes for all women's plus 6X shirts were consistent because they are not. These particular shirts are free flowing and not binding at all and the other ones that I purchased are a bit more clingy than I like. Still though I will keep all of them. Wish they had alot more colors like pink, white, yellow, green, etc in the 6X size. Hear me Amazon? I will buy more of these if you offer more colors! \n",

I wear it walking on cooler days and it does keep me warm. Some wicking fabrics can feel stiff or like plastic - but not a problem here. The fabric is smooth and comfortable. I like my shirts on the looser side so I sized up. For reference I'm 5'8, 150 lbs and a large fit well through the arms and gives me adequate wiggle room. I feel like a Medium would have been too confining. The other plus is the black doesn't appear to attract lint or pet hair, so it looks crisp and clean throughout the day. \n",

      "Review Text: I wore this shirt to hike the rim to rim at the grand canyon (25 miles). It was supposed to be a backup to my really expensive REI purchased shirts as I wasn't sure how well it would perform based on price but wanted something light/small in my pack just in case. It was 38 degrees when we started the hike. I wore this as an undershirt with a few other thin layers and it kept me warm enough. When it got warmer, this was the only shirt I ended up wearing all day. The temperature got up to 100 degrees in the canyon. I did not get sun burned, so i'm going to say the sun protection worked. Whenever I got too hot, I took the shirt off, soaked it in a creek, and put it back on soaking wet. It dramatically cooled me down and dried completely in about 15-20 mins. I wore the shirt 16+ hours. It did not chafe my skin, it did not smell, and it never looked dirty which is shocking because I was filthy (I wore the hot pink shirt). My only criticism is the sleeves were about 3 inches too short. I'm 5'9\" and 135 lbs and a 34B. The medium fit me perfectly other than short sleeves. It was a great shirt for the price. \n",

      "Color is very nice, just as pictured.\n",
      "But I’m disappointed in the cut all around. I have a tummy so can’t really go smaller, but the sleeves hang very long and wide. Since the sleeves are so wide at the wrist they won’t stay bunched at wrist. I either roll them up, or pull up to elbow which is a problem since I’m prone to skin cancer. Just had a cancer removed from forearm and want to be covered.\n",
      "It is also quite long so I just tuck into waist.\n",
      "4 star rating is based on sloppy-big cut.\n",

The fabric is too thin for my taste and shows bra lumps and color, even a light beige. I like the not-too-clingy fit of the XL (142 pounds, 5'6\"), sleeve length and overall length.

      "Review Text: I bought this shirt to use for hiking and thought it was a nice shirt for the price. I needed something moisture wicking and for blocking the sun and this seemed to tick both of those boxes. For reference I am 5' 8\" and about 180 lbs with most of my weight on my midsection and back side. I ordered an XL. This was long enough in both the torso and sleeves which can be challenging for me to find. I did feel it pulled strangely around the shoulder armpit area and the way the seam was sewn I felt like that would be an irritant after a while on the trail, especially when using trekking poles. So I ended up returning this and going with another Hanes product. It was a little bit of a bummer that this didn't work out for me but I still think it's an excellent product for what it is and for the price. Maybe you will have better success with it. \n",

I default to sports bras, but as someone with a larger chest, this can cause dysphoria :/ anyways! I tried this out, hoping for a bit of comression to alleviate dysphoria and let me tell you. For something that cost me $8? this is comparable to a binder. One con is that its a touch tight, so I'll probably still be cautious of my ribs and back while wearing it, and i probably wont wear it to work out, but the way it makes my chest look is absolutely amazing. I will definetly be ordering more! I'll order a size up and hopefully remember to update this review (a note on sizing: I wear a medium tshirt, so I ordered a medium. Like I said, its a little small, especially the band, so I'd say keep an eye on that!) \n",

      "Review Text: I have around 36 DD bra size, and measured 41 inches loosely around the underbust/ribcage and I bought an xL. I usually wear larges to xLs and most people said to size up and one person said to use ur ribcage in inches to order it if it's for binding so all that equaled an xL for me. It's really comfortable, nice fabric, feels very secure, and does give me the appearance of a smoother and slighter chest, which is great if you are enby. It functions the way I want all sports bras to function and I can wear it all day. It's not a binder. Don't expect a binder. People are saying it's tight? I don't think it's tight at all. It fits and it's comfortable. It might look tight in my pictures but it's really just sturdy, I saw people relate it to swimwear, I think that's a fair comparison. It has a nice low neckline so you can wear it with a lot of shirts (though if you're transmasc, fair warning, you will still have noticable cleavage in form fitting shirts) and honestly it looks really good by itself. My biggest complaint is that the material is stretchy (not like bad quality but like they made it to fit multiple shapes) so if you have a heavy chest, there will still be some sagging and I do feel like I keep having to pull the straps back up. I've thought about getting a smaller size but I think that will just make the waist band smaller and the waistband is fine, the material just has a touch too much give for my taste. For the price, it's great, and if you want a relaxed minimizer, something that is comfy and multifunctional that you would use when you don't think you can handle binding or want to feel good working out, I recommend it, but personally I could've enjoyed more restraint from it. \n",

      "Review Text: I need a high impact sports bra for running and have had a hard time finding one that provides adequate support. This one works well and is cheap. The straps are not adjustable and they are a bit long, so don’t provide me with much support from that direction (ie, its not pulling things UP), its really just squishing them really tight to your chest. Which works, mostly. I ended up wearing this plus another sports bra that was old and inadequate on its own for several months. I run a 10K every other day and i wash this every other day as well, so there’s some wear on it. After a few months, it wasn’t quite as good as before, so I bought another of this exact same item (its a great price point). I find that if I wear two of them together, it works the best. So I wear the first Hanes bra i purchased with this one together and I’m pretty good. I’m not large-busted, just average. Note: These are very tight and are actually quite difficult to get off after a run. I have to do quite a bit of contorting to get one off, let alone the two. If this bothers you, you may not want to get this bra. However, for me, the price and the support work out. My MIL sews, and I might see if I can get her to shorten the straps by about 1”. If she can, I think these bras would be better. \n",

      "Review Text: I ordered this bra to wear when working in the garden, which requires a lot of bending over. Sports bras primarily work on a compression principle, so I get that they need to be snug. However, when I initially purchased an XL, it was so tight that I could barely get it on, and it was clearly too small in every possible way. I then ordered the 2XL, and the only real size difference I can see is in the girth, with no allowance for actual larger breasts. The overall circumference is too loose for me, but my breasts bulge over at the sides when I put it on, and then spill out the center when I bend over. If it weren't cut so low, it could probably contain things better, but as it is, things go out of place every time I actually move; I am constantly having to reposition. I'm sure this is largely a body-type issue, and so this sports bra may be great for some, but for women like me with a large cup size relative to girth, I cannot recommend it. \n",

We have tried many bras, even doubling them up. I am very aware of the dangers of breast compression, so I make sure that I am very involved with the process. Many kids have died from DIY breast compression. Since Prime Wardrobe allows 7 days to try the item, I bothered my kid several times a day to see how the bra felt. Each day his response was better and better. He said it is indeed comfortable and the compression is better than anything he's tried. I was convinced after day 4 of 7, so I told Amazon we were keeping the bra and I ordered another one (now he has a black and a white).\n",

I was an xs/s in Nike (now a medium apparently) and I'm in between 32-34 DD, but I would prefer to wear this now. The medium fits perfectly on the band, but is a bit loose in the shoulder straps. It still fits better than the small since the band for the small would be too tight, and so I'll keep the medium. It's great stretchy material and shows more cleavage than any other sports bra, which can come in handy for certain tops. However it does not provide much of any support, so I wouldn't use it for any cardio or high impact workouts. It's worth it if you want something comfortable, but under armour (sized down to a small) fits me even better with better support. It's a preference thing! But for the price you can't beat this. \n",

I love the quality of the clothes, color selection, and how they are designed to keep you cool (or warm, depending on the line). I decided to get some more workout shirts this year and wanted to try some with a pattern rather than just the solid shirts, since I have some of those already.

      "This Under Armour Twist Tech shirt is part of Under Armour's HeatGear line, which is designed to keep you cool in warm weather. This shirt is considered a LOOSE fit, which means you will most likely want to purchase a smaller size for a more comfortable fit. The shirt has a flattering V-neck cut and has a twisted, or heathered, pattern that makes it different than a solid color shirt. These shirts are made in Jordan of 100% polyester. Washing instructions say to wash with similar colors. I always put these in the washing machine on a normal cycle, hang them up to dry, and I've never had a problem with shrinking.\n",

For size reference, I am 5'6\", 165 pounds, with a 36D chest and some extra belly fat from my twin pregnancy and I purchased a medium. I typically wear a medium or large in shirts and, since this shirt is a loose fit, I went with the medium and it fits perfectly! These shirts are so comfortable and I wear them a lot for working out. They keep me as cool and dry as possible (of course, I still sweat). They wash up well and I am also able to wear them for everyday wear with yoga pants. My mom is in her early 60s and wears these shirts for everyday wear, along with under her scrubs for work. She loves them as much as I do and wants to get some more!

Good fabric that is not sheer or too lightweight but has a nice athletic weight and also does not feel heavy on really hot days. The size is true to the size chart.

      "Review Text: I bought the hot pink color legging. I’m a size 10, 148 lbs. The size medium fit firm around the waist area, but not uncomfortable. It just keeps everything smooth and sucks you in around the waist area, without being oppressively tight or creating a muffin top. I think the leggings are great, but I had to take off one star because the material is sheer. I wore white underwear underneath with a very light design, and you could clearly see my underwear through the legging. And I don’t have a big posterior, so it’s not due to excessive stretching of the fabric. I only ordered the pink color, so I can’t speak to darker colors sheerness level. But the hot pink is a fabulous color! And I will still wear it with a tunic length top or longer oversized sweatshirt or sweater. \n",

      "Review Text: So many of my favorites from Amazon Essentials are going out of stock gradually I was shocked to see these newbies, and pleased! Ordered a few pair but kept only one because the pink was too good to pass up. The good: I'm a solid 6x/30 at Torrid, bottom heavy with big booty, hips and tummy, smaller waist. These fit great. At 5'4\" they come to my ankle. Rise is perfect even with my massive curves. One pair sent to me was accidentally a 5x; if I thought I could size down I found out the hard way that is NOT true. The waist was enough smaller that it would have popped stitches to pull them over my booty. Two gripes: 1) These are slippery like an athletic legging whereas I wish they had a softer feel and better rebound. Perhaps more cotton content or maybe microfiber like my favorite tights. 2) For my build, the calves and ankles were too big but not tremendously so. Again, with more rebound in the fabric that part could have been cut smaller and really fit to the leg. All things considered, and for how hard it is to find decent clothes this size, kudos Amazon and I recommend. I do not recommend wearing them in summer, they get pretty slimy. :) \n",

Length of torso is OK, but I would have liked about a couple of inches longer. If I had to buy again, I probably would pick large (which would cause the sleeves to be too long for me). Speaking of sleeves, after washing it the first time, the lower portion of the sleeves felt too tight. I was able to stretch the material to loosen it back up again, but that’s a lot of trouble to go through for something that’s supposed to be a casual (usually implying a comfortable) fit.\n",

      "Review Text: I ordered this shirt in White XL. I needed it for wearing under a turtleneck while walking in cold weather (50's). I'm 5'5 and 125. I work out and I'm fit. I do not have big guns - just fit arms. The arms on this shirt fit everywhere but the elbows - the elbows were tight. The remainder of the shirt was pretty loose and comfry. Again - I needed something a lttle loose for my outdoor workouts - I didn't want a skin-tight shirt. Basically - the shirt didn't fit. If you're bigger than I am - the torso of the shirt will fit but if you have \"bulky\" arms - forget it. I also ordered the same shirt in BLACK Large - I've found it's just easier to order two sizes online and keep one (pain but that's our world today). The black looked great but the arms would fit a kid - way too tight. It's almost as if they sewed the same arms on both shirts. Something is way off. I must say - it was 100% cotton. It's getting impossible to buy quality clothing these days. \n",

      "Review Text: Purchased 7 shirts like this. Normally my wife is a medium build, would wear a medium. This being 100% cotton, not yet shrunk to fit. We order the shirt tops one size larger, ordering 7 LARGE top shirts with long sleeves all made in Haiti. These shirts arrived in three separate packages. Opened them up, tried them on. Wife got her torso into the shirt, fit nicely around her shoulders and breasts. The ARM’s were MUCH TOO THIN & NARROW, she wasn’t able to get her arms fully into the tops. We were fearful of the seem coming apart had she forced her arms further into the top. We were and still are QUITE DISAPPOINTED as these tops had nice smooth feel and would be immensely comfortable had these LARGE tops fit fully with her medium frame. We returned ALL within a week, obtaining a full refund for each of the 7 tops. We are still looking for shirts of this type, AMERICAN MADE not foreign made. We loved the colors, loved cloth weight, but the arms for these LARGE top’s were like that of an EXTRA SMALL top - much too tight. \n",

      "Review Text: I ordered 2 of these T-shirts, one in the Sizzling Pink color and the other in a blue that is called Deep Dive. In both cases, the colors were MUCH different than they appeared on my computer screen. The pink looked like a muted rose color on my computer, but ended up more like its name -- a really bright, hot pink. The Deep Dive blue ended up being a vivid dark turquoise. I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large because other reviews said that these 100% cotton shirts would shrink quite a bit, and I don't like shirts that are too tight around my hips. When I first tried these t-shirts on, both were too large, and the sleeves were too long, so I washed them both in hot water and dried them in the dryer on high heat (instructions said to use cold water and low dryer heat). The turquoise shirt shrank to the perfect size including sleeve length. However, the bright pink shirt was still 2 or 3 inches too long in the sleeve, and I noticed that the neck was cut differently than on the turquoise shirt -- the turquoise one had a crew neck, and the pink one was lower, more of a scoop neck. Strange, because these two shirts were supposed to be identical except for color. I am keeping the turquoise shirt and returning the bright pink one. \n",

      "Review Text: I was traveling from a cold climate to a warm one and didn’t want to bring a jacket. I bought this shirt to wear under a blouse to and from the airport. It was perfect. I have since used it under a sweater on very cold days and it makes such a difference. Because of the other reviews I purposely bought one 2 sizes too big and pre washed it in warm water (instructions say to use cold). The first wash it shrunk one full size, the second just a bit more. It now fits perfectly. No tightness anywhere and the sleeves come to my wrist. The body length shrunk most but I still have a good 3-4 inches I can tuck into a skirt or pants. It is very thin and lightweight so it doesn’t feel bulky at all but still adds warmth. It is much too thin to wear alone but is so soft which is very important for my extremely sensitive skin. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. Since it’s basically a very comfortable long sleeve undershirt I think $6-8 a piece would be reasonable. At that price I would buy several more! I had bought some thicker pre-washed cotton long sleeve Ts at a local arts and crafts store for $5 each. They do the same job but this one is so much more comfortable. \n",

I often have a problem with sweatpants fitting properly based on the size I order which is Medium, but this particular pair lived up to its description and feel. I recommend this purchase to anyone looking for comfort and soft material used for stretching, exercising or walking. \n",

      "Review Text: I like this sports bra for the most part. The pros: It is super cute in the front and back where the straps crisscross. The pads or inserts are great because they stay where I want them and don’t slide around when wearing. When washing they stay inside the bra and hold their shape. They don’t come out in the washer (delicate cycle only and hang to dry) with those weird creases and wrinkles in them like some of my other sports bras. The cons: this bra has the crisscross straps in the front cleavage area. While this is a super cute design and looks great on the model, unless you are large busted the straps sort of sag. I ordered a Large, and am usually a 34-36 B, almost a C. While I don’t see myself as well endowed up top, I am certainly not flat chested. With that being said, the straps do sag in the middle cleavage area and stick out of the tops of my dry fit tanks that I wear to the gym. It is a bit annoying. So if you are big busted you probably won’t have any issues. If you are not, just keep in mind those cute little decorative crisscrossed straps at the cleavage will not be completely taut. Otherwise this is a fairly comfortable bra with decent support. \n",

Also not really thick enough for outdoor exercise, like true sweat pants. Not as thick and bulky as true sweat pants. Not too thick, not too thin, just right. I pair them with loose, cute, comfy tops, and tops that were with other loungewear bottoms. And I can mix and match these. I bought black and blue; mixing and matching allows me more outfits to wear. The gray ones do look like sweats, though. I want to look like loungewear, not sweats. HANES, WILL YOU MAKE THESE IN BROWN AND KHAKI?

The tops now fit and I don't want to make them any smaller. The pants are wearable if I roll the top over. So if you buy these and they are not a good fit, return and go down a size. As another review remarked, if they fit and you want to wear them, wash them first (cold water) because the amount of lint that comes off will fill the palm of your hand.\n",

I looked back at my order and I did submit the order correctly. Second, the pants are HUGE. I bought my regular size, the same that I purchased in the past, and I can't believe how big the pants are. But here is the problem. I need them right now so I am not returning them. I'm washing them in hot water and hope that they shrink, and one set is going to be a mismatch. What is also odd is the pieces are made in two different countries based on the labels and the packaging was a little different on each one.\n",

      "Review Text: 5’2” and 160 lbs. and bought 4 pair of these for $6 per pair. I needed some to lounge around at home, and even after reading the negative reviews, figured it was worth giving them a try as the price was right. Because of my height, I always pre-wash and machine dry washable pants at least 3 times before shortening them. Also, I am losing weight so don’t want to spend a lot of money on clothes right now and look for things I can wear while my weight goes up and down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, after washing and drying each pair 3 times, they each shrunk about 3 inches. That is actually pretty normal for sweats. They were about 4 1/2 inches too long, so that is all right for me. Also, they were washed in warm water with no liquid fabric softener, and dried on a normal cotton cycle using dryer sheets. The fabric and colors came out great with little piling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the fit, they actually fit just like the ones in the add. They are quite slim at the hips and wide in the legs. They also are short geared (length from the waist to the crotch area), so could be uncomfortable for someone medium height or taller. The waist elastic is fairly loose yet the hips fit snug. I have a more hour-glass shape so may fit better on someone with smaller hips or flatter butt. The worst part is how wide the legs are, with no tapering at all. It can be very unflattering. I am a seamstress, so can easily shorten the pants. As for the wide legs, there is no side Sean that could easily be taken in. The cheap price makes it worthwhile for me to spend the time changing them. I will probably unstitch the sides of the waistband, make side seams that taper a little, also taper the inner leg seams, tighten the waistband elastic, and should end up with nice looking, warm, and comfortable sweats that should last me through the rest of my weight loss process without spending a lot of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, if you are a slimmer built person who like the wider legs style or would just add elastic to the bottom of the legs, and can get these sweats at a great price, I do recommend them. The colors are great and the fabric is soft and comfy, warm but not too warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review update - I have finally worn a pair of these sweatpants. I’m 5’ 2” tall, 160 lbs., and hourglass shape. These sweatpants fit a little snug when first on, but after awhile fit just right around the waist and hips for me (a petite in pants). The rise (length from the natural waistline to the crotch area) is perfect, almost a little short. Also, after being washed and dried 3 times, the length is still 2 1/2” too long. That means these pants should fit a short person fine after hemming them, and an average person perfect in length and if they like a lower waistline. \n",

      "\n",
      "I wear a short length pant, or buy ankle-length pants to be the right length. I’m pretty small, too, so I’m easily dwarfed by clothes that are too big. Unfortunately, these pants are so gigantic I look like a first-grader wearing big sister’s clothes. When I compared the new ones to my others, the new ones are 4” longer, 2” wider, and the legs are 2” wider side-to-side than my others. They have gigantic legs, like palazzo pants, or something similar.\n",

      "This is very frustrating, because they should fit the same. I have 3 pairs of pants now that cannot be worn because of differences in the sizes. All say ‘Medium’ with no length noted. I don’t know how to sew, but I’m going to try to hem and take them up in the waist, at least I can sleep in them or work around the house in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure how I could’ve avoided this problem, and I think I shouldn’t have to worry, if the sizes are the same then they should fit the same. If you buy these, measure a pair that fit you well, and make sure that matches the dimensions given on-line. It’s too late to send these back, but they were only $7 each so I guess I’ll suck it up and go on! \n",

Unfortunately, I went with their recommendation and received a pair of pants far too huge for me.

      "Review Text: I ordered these pants on purpose. I have a few pairs of these exact leggings both from Costco and from Amazon. I ordered the white ones for a specific event and was prepared for them to not be “squat proof” but I did not buy them to do squats in so it’s fine. I did not want a heavy double lined pair of leggings, I needed a light and cool pair of white leggings. For general wear they are fine, just choose the right size and size up if you want to reduce the sheerness, and plan your undergarments accordingly. These are still my favorite brand of leggings for comfort, quality, style, durability and color options. I cut the tag out of the white ones which makes it much less obvious how see through they are, and especially with a little longer of a shirt it was perfectly fine. I love them! \n",

      "Review Text: These fit SO well! I’ve tried many leggings brands and by far these are the best. They have a soft, ‘buttery’ feel, do not scratch, itch, or irritate my skin (no funky seams that leave imprints), are very comfortable in the mid section and just fit really well. I usually wear a medium in leggings (even though I’m about 5’4” and 115#) because most leggings fit way too tight in a small (or it may just be that I don’t like leggings to look like I’m wearing tights without a skirt!)\n",

      "Review Text: I learned of this brand of leggings (from Costco) 2 winters ago and stocked up. Now that it is summer I decided to order some leggings. I have since completely switched my legging brand. These are so bitter and so comfy and so soft. The two differences that I notice are 1 they definitely are a little bit thinner, especially at the waist band. Also they seem to run slightly bigger. I am 5'1 125lbs, I prefer the size small in the pant leggings but totally go for a medium if I just want to be comfy cozy. With these length I ordered a small and they are still a little big, I was getting on here to return them for an xs but they don't have that size. Small would definitely be my \"comfy\" size. Would have given 4 stars if they were available in xs. \n",

      "Review Text: I like the fact that I am able to wear this shirt in the Florida heat while I garden without burning up. That was the main reason I bought it...to protect my arms from the sun while outside. I would recommend sizing up when you order, however. I am usually always a medium in a top and I found this medium to be too tight across the chest area. It fit fine through the shoulders and sleeves, just too tight through the upper torso. For reference, I am a 36D up top and a size 8 for slacks. So I'm not overly thick. I've been looking for long sleeved tops to wear to play tennis as well, and I think this material will work. Hoping the large isn't too big! \n",

      "Review Text: I have about 6 of these now, mostly v-neck style and long sleeve. I just ordered what seemed like a new color, very light gray/silver, but as it turns out, the photo is a bit misleading. I just received it and it is the same color as another I purchased about 2 years ago, just a different name and photo. The silverly looking color is actually darker than pictured, similar to the black heather color. Although my other shirt is still in excellent condition, like new, I will keep this one. I was hoping for a lighter color to wear in the summer but this is not it. Aside from that, these fit fairly loose but I order a size up, a medium, so I can move around comfortably in it. I find the cool-dri works well in the summer heat when I am doing many farm chores outside. The long sleeves keep my arms clean, dry and protected from the sun. I wear the heck out of these in the summer and they have never come apart or shown signs of wear. I am truly impressed, especially for the price. In the winter, I use them for my workouts and never feel overheated or sweaty at the end so they do breath. I am 5'4\", 122 lbs. and prefer the medium, although a small would probably fit well, just a bit more snug than I prefer. \n",

I typically opt for the racerback tank top style for my workout shirts but I'm also very fair-skinned and I wanted a bit more protection from the sun for my shoulders and back when I'm outside during peak sunshine hours. I own a number of Under Armour products so I was well aware of the quality when I decided to purchase this shirt. Like a lot of people, I was hesitant on the sizing since Under Armour's clothes fit differently depending on the style. Under Armour classifies this shirt as a loose fit as opposed to semi-fitted, fitted, or compression fit.\n",

      "For reference, I am 5'6\", 150 pounds, with a 36D chest and a medium fits me perfectly! I wear a medium or large depending on the style and fit of the shirt but, thanks to the help of other reviewers, I was able to successfully order my correct size for this shirt. This shirt is part of UA's Heatgear line which is meant to keep you cool when it's warm out. I've already worn this shirt several times and it is incredibly comfortable. It is made in Jordan of 100% polyester and is very soft and lightweight. It is so comfortable that I don't have any problems with range of motion or anything while exercising. This shirt is a V-neck style which is nice since it adds a little bit of a design over the scoop neck style shirts and it still has good chest coverage so I don't feel like I'm indecent while bending over. It has an UA logo on the left side of the chest as well as one on the back of the shirt, just below the neck. The length is also really nice and comfortably rests on my upper thighs. I've worn this shirt while walking and playing basketball and have still managed to stay fairly cool. Even though this shirt is lightweight, I don't feel that it's sheer and would show anything that's not meant to be seen. The shirt also washes up nicely. I typically hang dry these shirts so they don't get caught on anything in the dryer and so far, they've been great!\n",

      "I'm so happy I found this shirt because it's become my go-to t-shirt for working out when I don't want to wear my racerbacks. I originally ordered the Montana Teal/Metallic Silver color and loved it so much that I also ordered Flint/Metallic Silver and Coho/Metallic Silver. I've included a picture of my three shirts so you can see what they look like. At first I thought the Flint/Metallic Silver was a gray color but when I got it, it's actually more of a dusky lilac and, since I love purple, I am even happier! I think the hardest thing for most people is to figure out what size to order for this shirt. My thoughts are, if you have two sizes of shirts that you normally order depending on the brand and style, order the smaller size for this shirt. That's what I did and these shirts ended up fitting me perfectly. They are even nice enough to wear out in public so they are definitely versatile. I highly recommend these shirts because they are great for exercising, there are a lot of colors to choose from, and the price is perfect so you can order more than one! \n",

      "Review Text: These are great shirts to feed horses in, as the hay doesn't stick to the shirts. They are great shirts to layer with, they wick moisture away from you, and they are comfortable. However, if you sweat in them, it will be difficult to tell who is stinkier, you or your sweaty horse. They also do not dry out quickly if you hang them up. If you hang them up on the radiator, they will dry and they will still stink, ergo only 4 stars. If you feed horses three times a day in the Winter, you need three of these shirts or your body will basically be a party bus for sweat swilling bacteria. An Ariat Lowell shirt is basically the same material, but the material does not trap odor like the Under Armour, and you can hang up and air out and wear the Ariat more than once. Would be nice if UA could fix this issue, as washing all those shirts isn't exactly environmentally friendly, even if it means they sell more shirts. If the UA shirt was not on sale, I honestly would not have bought so many of them. \n",

I like the light weight, the length of the sleeves and length overall. The shirt dries more quickly than another brand I wear. Because it is so thin, I can see how lighter colors might be transparent, and I’ll stick to darker colors if I buy more. If you can get the shirt for less than $20, I think it’s a good value.

      "Review Text: When I first got these, I was a bit disappointed about the weight of the fabric, it's very lightweight, almost like a T-shirt material. When that order arrived, I really didn't think I'd get much use out of them. I was wrong. It was still winter, and I put them in a closet and almost forgot about them. Then on a cooler summer day, I was cold, but it wasn't warm enough for my normal fleece sweatshirts. Then I remembered these buried in my closet and pulled one out. It was perfect! I was warm, but not overheated.\n",

      "I started to wear them when we went out to eat. I'm always cold in diners and restaurants, but my fleece sweatshirts are usually too much; I'm too warm with them on and too cool with them off, so I wind up draping them over my shoulders, and I'm constantly having to reposition them because they slip down. These lightweight sweatshirts are just perfect in a cold restaurant.\n",

      "I had originally purchased only 2 of these, but after using them all summer long, I bought 4 more. Now with the cooler weather moving in, I'm wearing these around the house, and when I go outside, I put one of my fleece sweatshirts on over them. I have a lot of fleece sweatshirts and wear only a couple of them because my skin is very sensitive and I can't wear any scratchy material against my skin. After numerous washings, the once soft lining of my heavy fleece sweatshirts gets stiff and scratchy, and for me, very uncomfortable. So basically out of about 4 dozen fleece sweatshirts, I only wear a few of the newest ones that are still kind of soft. I've found that I can wear one of these lightweight sweatshirts under my heavy fleece ones, and I'm comfortable because these sweatshirts are just so soft. With using these as liners, I can now go back to using my entire collection of sweatshirts comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for fit, I always buy any kind of outerwear in a larger size than I actually wear. I do this so I can layer different articles of clothing, depending on how cold I am. I wear an XL, but buy sweatshirts and jackets in either 2X or 3X. The lightweight sweatshirts I purchased are 3X, but I feel they fit more like a 2X, so I would recommend sizing up a bit.\n",

      "All in all I really love these hoodies! If you are like me and are cold most of the time, these will give you the little bit of warmth that you need for those in-between conditions where you're cold, but a fleece sweatshirt is too warm. These are just right. \n",

      "Review Text: I’ve purchased multiples of these lightweight hoodies in different colors over the years. I take them everywhere and live in them all summer with cold indoor air conditioned offices & buildings. I’m a 2x in most plus sized brands. The2x JMS hoodie fits more like a 1x on me. What I’ve found out by buying these again & again and not truly paying attention to the actual label brand, is that the Hanes Her Way slub hoodies (which are exactly the same hoodie in regular women’s sizing) in XXL fit much more comfortably than the JMS 2x. I can zip the HHW xxl and still have a comfortable fit & feel, but if I zip the JMS 2X, I look & feel like a stuffed sausage lol.\n",
      "Both brands have a similar oddity in that the bright colors are a tad smaller with less stretch than the black & white colors (although not enough of a difference to size up, just something I noticed). Bottom line with these- if you’re sold on the Just My Size branding, go up 1 size, or get the same thing in the Hanes Her Way in XXL. \n",

      "Review Text: Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted. I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lot\n",

      "Final thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors. Lululemon who? \n",

      "I now have 2 XL that fit better as shirts (light support) and just got a L that fits tighter and has more support like an actual sports bra. I'd say medium support. They don't LOOK that different but I guess I'd recommend sizing down for a more supportive fit and using your regular size for a more casual fit. It that makes sense!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had found some other tanks I loved but couldn't really wear them out of the house as an plus size/XL due to the lack of padding and wanted something I didn't have to change out of if I needed to run an errand or walk the dogs. As a B-C cup (depending on the bra) and and XL tshirt size, these are amazing and I've now ordered another color in the XL size of the tank. I feel like they're fitted enough to smooth and give me plenty of lift and support which I was skeptical of since I'm not a \"perky\" lady if ya catch my drift. I also love the thickness of the straps and the feel of the material. I wear them as shirts in various settings and feel plenty comfortable to do so but would not wear them to a \"jumpy/bouncy\" workout class- they're not THAT supportive. I will also say that they're not modest and do end up showing a decent amount of cleavage so if that's not your jam, you may end up returning. \n",

(UPDATE: got the large today and the straps are slightly too long which is causing gapping in my armpits, probably should stick with a medium). The medium sizing I slightly spilled out of the top and bottom of the cami and the top just rode up on my waist while moving around. I think you could get away with medium if you are okay with a slightly tighter top. But you will get spillage.

I love the bootcut/open bottom as I don’t like yoga pants that are essentially leggings - if I wanted leggings, I’d get leggings. My biggest complaint is the waistband. It’s a bit stiff and while I get that it’s supposed to help with not rolling, it’s also a tad narrow - these are not high waisted pants. Given the stiffness and shorter waistband, I don’t see myself wearing these for yoga. Comfortable and stretchy, sure, but I can’t do malasana without risking a big gap in the back - I don’t want to have to worry about making sure my shirt is long enough or that I’m not trying out for a plumber’s calendar when working on my poses.

I went with the medium and it fits perfectly. I'm losing weight and they will still fit well even if I lose another 10 pounds. The length is just right for my height, so if you are tall, with long legs, these might be a bit short on you.

I got a medium because it was a few dollars cheaper at the time, I definitely could have gotten a small or an extra small if they had it. They have a lot of stretch although I’m not sure the material is strong enough to be stretched out repeatedly. Because they are so stretchy they aren’t as flattering as yoga pants that really “hold you in”.

      "\n",
      "Ordered the XL because at my age, I'm done with constricting clothing. Since I'm short, they come closer to my natural waist than the ones on the model, and the hem falls a wee bit lower. [Hint: if, after being washed a few times, the leggings start to come apart at the inseam, ask yourself if it's just that they've been WORN a few times - presumably that's why they were washed - and that maybe you should try a bigger size.] These are totally opaque on me - another reason I ordered the XL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presumably some marketing person came up with \"wide waistband\" as a way of explaining their construction. In actuality, they have a double thickness yoke at the top - as a close look at the image will show. Between the layers of fabric, a piece of elastic perhaps 5/8\" wide is stitched into place. This, along with the lack of a side seam, the gusset, and the substantial, stretchy fabric must be why these leggings fit so many different women so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, the cotton-rich fabric feels great, though I will be sticking to black. I would love to have a true charcoal or gray, but of course these days what they usually mean is a lighter or darker heather, which for some reason has a higher polyester content. (At least it does in the Charcoal Jockeys, otherwise I wouldn't always find myself reaching for them last.) The \"wicking liner\" doesn't hurt, but - being not much bigger than the triangle you see on a suit pocket handkerchief - doesn't add much either\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I undergo frequent \"climate\" changes (both the internal and external kind), these are my daily at-home uniform for about half the year. On a mild winter day, they're enough protection for a quick trip to the mailbox, especially if I pull on a pair of boots/booties. If it's cold, I can quickly throw a pair of regular pants over them. Yet, they're not unbearable in an overheated room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, they don't cover my lower legs and make them itchy - though probably not as itchy as the fashionistas get when contemplating this uniform, which is worn by legions of women with less-than-perfect bodies. The way I figure it, these esthetically sensitive types are lucky that most of us pair them with long, boxy tunics!\n",

      "PS After this, I was delighted to find Jockey makes a line of mostly-cotton \"judo\" leggings, which are not only the perfect \"knicker\" length for me (just below the knee), but also cost less. Haven't seen these on Jockey's site or in its catalog, but Amazon offers a plain pair, a shirred knee version (with what look like functional drawstrings tied at the sides), and a fancied-up athletic job (  Jockey Women's Athletic Judo Legging  ) which I ordered and reviewed separately. \n",

Jockey is a great brand, but I guess you should expect everything of theirs to be intimates. I do like them but haven't made the effort to wear them regularly out of concern for damaging the fabric and construction. The knees of the pants stretch out with wear and have tightened up with the first few washes so far, but who knows when they'll permanently stretch. These are definitely loungewear or to be worn with your butt covered. They're not terribly sheer but you shouldn't take the chance. I also have average sized but muscular calves and the opening is tight enough to be annoying. If I decide to buy this again I do want to try size medium.

The fabric was not soft and stretchy, the Jockey name was on the front, the length was super short capri. So be aware that you might not know what you are getting. Remarkably the RN#50369 is the same on both as is the 92% cotton/8% spandex. The feel and fit are different as you can see in the picture the non soft stretchy is smaller than the other. \n",

Haven't had them very long, and one pair already got a hole in them. They aren't shear, so it's not a problem of thin fabric, they just aren't very durable. Also, if you are between sizes, you probably need to size up. \n",

You can see right through them with stretching just slightly! I knew the minute I picked up one of them up that they were not the same. Very lightweight compared to my older ones. Nowhere near the quality yet the same high price. Shame on Jockey. You’ve lost a good customer as I will not buy these again and don’t trust quality of other items now. I can’t recommend these based on low quality, especially given the high price. \n",

      "Review Text: I do medium/high impact workouts. And good workout bras are EXPENSIVE! One day all my good workout bras were dirty, so I doubled up on these bras. And guess what, with 2 of these bras at the same time (1 camisole bralette & 1 sports bralette) - I was just as supported as my good workout bra - for a whole $8!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what I have learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "TYPES - There are now MANY types of bras under this one heading. I have both the CAMISOLE type and the SPORTS BRALETTE type (both have spaghetti straps are not adjustable). I would NOT call them sports bras, but rather \"bralettes\" or shelf bras. They feel like cotton and have non-adjustable straps (but the non-adjustability does not seem to be an issue for most people). I bought both in the white, black, grey sets. The sports bralette type has ruching, that doesn't look all that great and doesn't really add to the bra. But the straps of the sports bralette are really cute. The sports bralette comes with ONE set of padded inserts that can be moved from one sports bralette to the other. Because I always wear a shirt when working out, these inserts are unnecessary, so I am not using them. The set of inserts comes with the sports bralette, but NOT with the camisole type. To confirm you are buying the correct type, make sure you click on the color options and look at the accompanying photos, because the DESCRIPTION DOES NOT CHANGE!\n",
      "\n",
      "SIZING - I am a 34D(or DD) or a 36C/D. And with these bralettes I wear a 38. It feels snug and appropriately supported. For the bralettes I bought, the camisole type actually fits a bit more snug and the sports bralette type fits a bit looser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my sizing and what I have read from the other reviews, here is how I would guess the sizing works:\n",
      "A cup - go actual size.\n",
      "B cup - Sports Bralette go actual size, Camisole go up 1 size.\n",
      "C cup - go up 1 size.\n",
      "D cup - go up 1 size for Sports Bralette and 2 sizes for Camisole.\n",
      "DD and bigger - go up 2 sizes. But if you are well endowed with a small rib cage (e.g., 32 DD or bigger) then this bra may not work for you, because if you go up more than 2 sizes, the band at the bottom may be too big. (But again, for me with a 34D(or DD) or a 36C/D - a 38 is perfect.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whew - get all that? :) Again, this is all only a guess - but hopefully my guessing helps a little. Basically the bigger your cup size, the more sizes up you need to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "(UPDATE: It is now May 2020, we are 2 months into the COVID 19 Pandemic and are \"sheltering in place\". Consequently it is now 2 months since I have worn an underwire bra! Even though my size 38s are still great and still work after 3 years of use, they are now a bit tighter, so I use them when I want more support/working out. But I wanted something a little less tight for \"sheltering in place\", so I bought a size 40 of the \"sports bralette\" with the ruching. I am essentially living in them - both for sleep and working around the house all day. But the reason for writing this update (beside the fact that these are truly good enough to live in) is that the sports bralettes I just purchased no longer have the separate pad to insert into the bralette for 'modesty'. So if you order the sports bralette it is unlikely that you will receive a removable pad.)\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW I WEAR THEM - I use the camisole type when I have a low cut shirt and too much cleavage is a bit inappropriate. Sometimes I wear it alone, or sometimes I wear my bra under it. I also use it alone for low impact sports (I just wore is skiing and it was perfect.) Or for my high impact workouts I use the sports bralette type and the camisole type together - in the same color, and all the straps look pretty cute! Also, because the straps are all in different places, it doesn't hurt my neck/top of my shoulders like some of my \"real\" sports bra do - the pressure/weight is spread out if you use the 2 different bra types together. (I have included 3 pictures of my back: a) camisole; b) sports bralette and c) both together.)\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHING: make sure to hang dry these bras - but other than that I have had no issue with either the quality or the washing of these bras. The directions say to hand wash and hang dry, but machine washing and hang drying seem to be fine. (On the other hand, if they are too big when you buy them, stick them in the dryer, because they will shrink a bit!)\n",
      "\n",
      "IN SUM - at $4-5 a bra it is an amazing price point. And for $8-10 to double them up and use them for workouts is awesome! And they are much cuter than my ugly old workout bras. I hope this is helpful to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "2018 UPDATE: I have now been using the same bralettes (2 packs of 3) for more than a year. They have gotten a hint smaller over time (even though I always hang them dry). But they still fit, they still have great elastic, they are still soft and they still look just as good as the day I bought them. These have been a GREAT purchase! \n",

      "Review Text: Tank tops are pretty much a staple to me. I wear them throughout the spring, summer, and fall. Heck, I even wear them in the winter. We live in Louisiana, and it's often uncomfortably warm and sticky, even in December. Most tanks are either too plain/athletic, meaning they're tight and utilitarian, or over-designed, with a bunch of strange decorations around the neckline and perhaps a goofy bottom hem. This is pretty perfect.\n",
      "On the surface, it's a tank top. But it fits loose, meaning it can have a bit of a dressier look as well as not make you feel self-conscious about imperfections along your midriff area. It really is a bit flowy without being too much; you absolutely can use this to exercise/move about in. I do wish it came in a non-racerback version. While this has a thicker back section than some, it still will show some bra strap. If I were to wear this to work, I'd definitely have to wear a cardigan or jacket over it.\n",

Now that I have lost some weight AND have a quality sports bra, I have started wearing it all of the time for outdoor tennis. It is inexpensive; that is a plus. However, the tags in mine crunched up into a sharp-edged wad on the first washing (I followed the directions to the letter!). This tag wad either stuck up or cut into the top of my back; I finally cut the tags out. Just not worth the scratching. Also, the stitching on the garment was second-quality at best.

I wanted another pair and chose blue. In the past with other Amazon brand clothing items I've noticed inconsistency in the products. I have shirts I ordered from the same listing same time and they are all different sizes and fits. I was really hoping these pants would be the same as the black and quality hadn't changed. Unfortunately they changed. The blue pair I received has much thinner material. It's less stretchy. I compared waistband sizes and the blue are about 2 inches smaller than the black. The elastic in the blue feels awful. It feels cheap and it doesn't stretch at all. They had a good thing going with these and like all things Amazon they had to change it up for worse quality items. Won't be buying again \n",

      "My first two sweatshirts were made in Vietnam, this most recent one, the navy & white stripe was made in Pakistan. The stitching, the material, the feel. Everything is subpar. The other two have a real cozy sweatshirt material, gets softer on the inside with every washing. Like a real high quality sweatshirt. The cuffs & neckline fit nicely, the stitching is well done. The striped one, the fabric feels almost plasticky & the inner lining feels like a cheap old Christmas stocking. The stitches are far too apart, they look so haphazardly done. The cuffs & neckline ribbing are scratchy & look like they will stretch out. I’m so disappointed.\n",

These are plenty long even after drying after every wash. I’ve noticed no shrinking at all and I’ve had my original pants for years. Secondly, the pants are well made, last a long time and are super comfy. They are generously sized so as a size 6 a small fits perfect. Last, I would say they are between regular pants and sweats…comfy but do not look like sweats so are OK to wear out and about.

I literally have to pull the waste of these pants to under my ribcage in order not to step on the bottoms or drag them across the floor. My opinion? The legs are also too loose, the overall look sloppy while wearing them. The logo is at the bottom of the left leg. To cut them to a desirable length is not an option. Length factors into the lack of comfort, otherwise they are comfortable enough due to the given description of the material. They're lightweight cotton, therefore stretch is not a consideration.

I ordered the size Large in these sweats. When they arrived I put them on and maybe an inch past the heel of my foot and loose fit, but not bad. Then I immediately washed them in HOT (my hot is very hot) and dried them on HOT. They came out perfect. Hem was right at floor level and the fit was great. They're sweats, I like my sweats a little loose. That said, the medium would have been too body hugging for me; I personally don't want to see my panty lines when in lounge wear. Hope this helped...I tried to be as specific as I could.\n",

I prefer to roll the waistband because they do come up too high. I am 5”3, 175lbs with a straight figure. There are no pockets which I do not mind because never use them anyway. They retain shape well especially after washing. This can be worn over thermals, the waist band has a string to tighten the waist but I don’t use it. These are gentle on the skin for anyone worried about texture. Truly are a great value for the money, I ordered in the other two colors as well. They truly are a comfortable pant!\n",

Love, love the pants as they are well constructed, with good material and even stitching, and as they are soft inside, warm, but not hot, feel very comfortable, and look cute. They fit me well everywhere except for the length, which just barely hits just at or a tiny bit above my ankles when I am standing barefooted. I'll probably just wear them inside the house.

      "12/23/22 update: Forget the 10 stars. I still like the comfort & warmth, but theses joggers \"grow\" on you. Good is that after having been worn twice they dropped a little and are now the perfect length for me. Not so good is that the joggers stretch with movements, and with no recovery to the material, become out of shape and remain loose. You'd need to be wearing a new pair if traveling or going somewhere special, as their well-fitted look morphs into a comfy but sloppy type of \"wear at home\" look. These joggers still earn my 4-star rating for home use due to their comfort & warmth. I have a 2nd pair which I am saving for Christmas day as temps will be below freezing. Hopefully they will look good for the length of the family get-together. I'd planned to purchase a 3rd pair, but instead might just wear leggings reversed (to prevent rubbing damage) under a pair of jeans for warmth when leaving the house on those exceptionally cold days.\n",

She wears a girls size 5.5 shoe which I think translates to a woman’s 5-5.5 or 6. Something like that. Girls socks in the kids section were pretty tight and small on her so using the size chart on here, I decide to buy these in a woman’s size S for her. They fit her perfectly. She likes the little cushioned tab at the back of the ankle. I purchased these with a 6 pack of puma socks which you can see in my video as well. The puma socks msrp for $18 but I paid less than $9 because Amazon had them marked down. The puma socks are actually a little bit thicker than these Saucony ones and they seem to be a little bit better made. The Saucony socks have some messy, loose threading that were stitched a little sloppily, but nothing to get all up in arms about. Even despite the messy threads being stitched into the seams, they are stitched together pretty well and seem like they will hold together well. I like that they are blue/darker colored which will definitely hide the wear & tear better than a traditional white sock. I will update my review after they get washed and get some mileage out on them 😊\n",

They are perfect for sneakers during the winter because they're a tad thick. So cushy but not too thick actually and my toes like them because I can't feel the seam. I think I'll have no problem with them in the summer time either because I like the support from the cushion on the bottom.\n",

      "Review: These socks are perfect! I had to stop using the brand of socks I used to buy, because they started using a toxic chemical in their socks to make them more cheaply (but charged the same amount for them!), and I didn't want that near me. I went searching for socks with the little heel tab, and found these. No toxic substances here, and they're super comfy! The tab protects my poor ankles from the backs of my shoes, and they have just the right amount of padding. They're so nice that my boyfriend slowly and steadily stole a bunch of them from me. I wore several pairs out, as well, so I just had to get more. As long as this company doesn't cheap out at customers' expense down the line, I think I'll stick with these socks going forward!\n",

      "Review: I was reluctant to purchase these socks because they are so cheap, but I am a fan of Saucony shoes and decided to give them a chance. They are every bit as soft and \"squeezy\" on my feet as the name-brand socks I've been wearing for decades. I like my socks to feel smooth and to cling to my feet without feeling tight -- or as I said, \"squeeezy\". Another plus is that my shoe size is women''s 12, and even the largest women's socks tend to be stretched to the max to fit my feet, so I've had to wear men's socks that only come in white, black, or gray. By contrast, these Saucony socks have women's sizes large enough to fit comfortably and the colors are pretty, too. I highly recommend these socks.\n",

Maybe the fabric changed...or maybe some colors are different...but the two shirts I received are buttery soft, almost a marshmallow texture, and not shiny at all. What's more, the fit is amazing! Not the tiny \"women's sizes\" of some brands (who must think we're all 13 years old). These have the same sizing as other women's shirts and blouses. If you wear a large in other tops, order a large! They also have a very slightly fitted shape so they skim over the hips without stretching or being big and boxy through the waist. (The large is about two inches wider around the bottom hem than at the bust.) I also love the length--not cropped, not a tunic. They hit about mid-hip. Well done, Amazon Essentials!

The shirt will be a bit loose when I get to that weight but for now, it fits me like a glove with room to spare. The medium had a loose neckline and fit me rather baggy. So make sure to size down as I usually am a medium and this shirt kind of surprised me as I rarely wear a small-sized shirt being 128 and sometimes weighing up to 131 lbs. So do your homework.

It was supposed to be a backup to my really expensive REI purchased shirts as I wasn't sure how well it would perform based on price but wanted something light/small in my pack just in case. It was 38 degrees when we started the hike. I wore this as an undershirt with a few other thin layers and it kept me warm enough. When it got warmer, this was the only shirt I ended up wearing all day. The temperature got up to 100 degrees in the canyon. I did not get sun burned, so i'm going to say the sun protection worked. Whenever I got too hot, I took the shirt off, soaked it in a creek, and put it back on soaking wet. It dramatically cooled me down and dried completely in about 15-20 mins. I wore the shirt 16+ hours. It did not chafe my skin, it did not smell, and it never looked dirty which is shocking because I was filthy (I wore the hot pink shirt). My only criticism is the sleeves were about 3 inches too short. I'm 5'9\" and 135 lbs and a 34B. The medium fit me perfectly other than short sleeves. It was a great shirt for the price.\n",

The fabric is too thin for my taste and shows bra lumps and color, even a light beige. I like the not-too-clingy fit of the XL (142 pounds, 5'6\"), sleeve length and overall length. I will keep it to wear as a winter underlayer.\n",

      "Review: I bought this shirt to use for hiking and thought it was a nice shirt for the price. I needed something moisture wicking and for blocking the sun and this seemed to tick both of those boxes. For reference I am 5' 8\" and about 180 lbs with most of my weight on my midsection and back side. I ordered an XL. This was long enough in both the torso and sleeves which can be challenging for me to find. I did feel it pulled strangely around the shoulder armpit area and the way the seam was sewn I felt like that would be an irritant after a while on the trail, especially when using trekking poles. So I ended up returning this and going with another Hanes product. It was a little bit of a bummer that this didn't work out for me but I still think it's an excellent product for what it is and for the price. Maybe you will have better success with it.\n",

I default to sports bras, but as someone with a larger chest, this can cause dysphoria :/ anyways! I tried this out, hoping for a bit of comression to alleviate dysphoria and let me tell you. For something that cost me $8? this is comparable to a binder. One con is that its a touch tight, so I'll probably still be cautious of my ribs and back while wearing it, and i probably wont wear it to work out, but the way it makes my chest look is absolutely amazing. I will definetly be ordering more! I'll order a size up and hopefully remember to update this review (a note on sizing: I wear a medium tshirt, so I ordered a medium.

      "Review: I have around 36 DD bra size, and measured 41 inches loosely around the underbust/ribcage and I bought an xL. I usually wear larges to xLs and most people said to size up and one person said to use ur ribcage in inches to order it if it's for binding so all that equaled an xL for me. It's really comfortable, nice fabric, feels very secure, and does give me the appearance of a smoother and slighter chest, which is great if you are enby. It functions the way I want all sports bras to function and I can wear it all day. It's not a binder. Don't expect a binder. People are saying it's tight? I don't think it's tight at all. It fits and it's comfortable. It might look tight in my pictures but it's really just sturdy, I saw people relate it to swimwear, I think that's a fair comparison. It has a nice low neckline so you can wear it with a lot of shirts (though if you're transmasc, fair warning, you will still have noticable cleavage in form fitting shirts) and honestly it looks really good by itself. My biggest complaint is that the material is stretchy (not like bad quality but like they made it to fit multiple shapes) so if you have a heavy chest, there will still be some sagging and I do feel like I keep having to pull the straps back up. I've thought about getting a smaller size but I think that will just make the waist band smaller and the waistband is fine, the material just has a touch too much give for my taste. For the price, it's great, and if you want a relaxed minimizer, something that is comfy and multifunctional that you would use when you don't think you can handle binding or want to feel good working out, I recommend it, but personally I could've enjoyed more restraint from it.\n",

      "Review: I need a high impact sports bra for running and have had a hard time finding one that provides adequate support. This one works well and is cheap. The straps are not adjustable and they are a bit long, so don’t provide me with much support from that direction (ie, its not pulling things UP), its really just squishing them really tight to your chest. Which works, mostly. I ended up wearing this plus another sports bra that was old and inadequate on its own for several months. I run a 10K every other day and i wash this every other day as well, so there’s some wear on it. After a few months, it wasn’t quite as good as before, so I bought another of this exact same item (its a great price point). I find that if I wear two of them together, it works the best. So I wear the first Hanes bra i purchased with this one together and I’m pretty good. I’m not large-busted, just average. Note: These are very tight and are actually quite difficult to get off after a run. I have to do quite a bit of contorting to get one off, let alone the two. If this bothers you, you may not want to get this bra. However, for me, the price and the support work out. My MIL sews, and I might see if I can get her to shorten the straps by about 1”. If she can, I think these bras would be better.\n",

      "Review: I ordered this bra to wear when working in the garden, which requires a lot of bending over. Sports bras primarily work on a compression principle, so I get that they need to be snug. However, when I initially purchased an XL, it was so tight that I could barely get it on, and it was clearly too small in every possible way. I then ordered the 2XL, and the only real size difference I can see is in the girth, with no allowance for actual larger breasts. The overall circumference is too loose for me, but my breasts bulge over at the sides when I put it on, and then spill out the center when I bend over. If it weren't cut so low, it could probably contain things better, but as it is, things go out of place every time I actually move; I am constantly having to reposition. I'm sure this is largely a body-type issue, and so this sports bra may be great for some, but for women like me with a large cup size relative to girth, I cannot recommend it.\n",

It fits perfectly, the material is breathable, it looks good enough so I can wear it privately or publicly, the price was a steal and it washes easily. I searched high and low in physical stores for a sports bra like this and came up short every time until I found this gem. One of my best purchases.\n",

I have run with this on multiple 5K and didn't have any breathing issues.\n",

It was too big for me; big enough it didn’t feel like a compression sports bra. If you are uncertain, it would be fine to just order both and see what you prefer. Amazon returns are so easy these days. Other than the sizing conundrum, the material is good, it is comfortable. There are no pads so if that bothers you this is not the bra for you.\n",

It doesn't compress my chest to the point where it's hard to breathe or damaging in any way, but it does a really good job of flattening my chest out enough that I can wear tshirts without feeling huge in it. You know the feeling.... the whole \"If im not wearing something 100% form fitting, my shirt transforms me into a box\" thing. I want to be able to relax at home or go to a grocery store when I feel crappy about my appearance, but also don't want to look boxy. This compression bra does the trick 100%. on the one hand, it's nice to wear under an oversized tshirt when I dont want to deal with having annoying boobs, but on the other hand, if i WANT to show off cleavage, this compression bra is low cut and tight enough that it REALLY highlights all the assets I would want to highlight. Basically, best of both worlds! Feel more flat when you want, and feel more booby when you want. You just gotta position the girls differently lol.\n",

      "I first ordered it with Prime Wardrobe because we've tried lots of bras and weren't that impressed with the compression. My son is very sweet and wants to be sure everyone is happy, so he sometimes says that something is good, even if it isn't. When it comes to bras, he tends to be honest about what he thinks of them. We have tried many bras, even doubling them up. I am very aware of the dangers of breast compression, so I make sure that I am very involved with the process. Many kids have died from DIY breast compression. Since Prime Wardrobe allows 7 days to try the item, I bothered my kid several times a day to see how the bra felt. Each day his response was better and better. He said it is indeed comfortable and the compression is better than anything he's tried. I was convinced after day 4 of 7, so I told Amazon we were keeping the bra and I ordered another one (now he has a black and a white).\n",

      "Review: This is the first time I've tried this brand since ditching Nike after they changed how they make their sports bras. I was an xs/s in Nike (now a medium apparently) and I'm in between 32-34 DD, but I would prefer to wear this now. The medium fits perfectly on the band, but is a bit loose in the shoulder straps. It still fits better than the small since the band for the small would be too tight, and so I'll keep the medium. It's great stretchy material and shows more cleavage than any other sports bra, which can come in handy for certain tops. However it does not provide much of any support, so I wouldn't use it for any cardio or high impact workouts. It's worth it if you want something comfortable, but under armour (sized down to a small) fits me even better with better support. It's a preference thing! But for the price you can't beat this.\n",

(However, DONT size down a lot, it’s already really tight). Since my chest is so large, it didn’t nearly flatten me out completely, but it did make me a couple cup sizes smaller, which is really great. For someone with a smaller chest I’m sure it would be able to serve as an actual binder and flatten you out a lot more.\n",

Wearing binders makes me feel... masculine in a way, or less womanly??? so I prefer the bras lol, even if it doesn’t matter either way. Regardless, these bras seem to work even better than binders. I think this makes me look like i’ve gone from a DDD to C. In terms of “bounce” for working out- there’s still bounce, but for something that’s just a piece of fabric for 10$, it does an amazing job of reducing it significantly. I honestly love it- I’ll prob buy more. I included one phot of me in a loose fitting tshirt while wearing a normal, DDD bra, and other while i’m wearing this compression bra. The third is a picture of me IN the bra. For reference, I am 5’, 105-110 lbs, a 32DDD and I ordered a size XS.

I love the quality of the clothes, color selection, and how they are designed to keep you cool (or warm, depending on the line). I decided to get some more workout shirts this year and wanted to try some with a pattern rather than just the solid shirts, since I have some of those already. I didn't have any of the Twist Tech shirts and decided to give them a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Under Armour Twist Tech shirt is part of Under Armour's HeatGear line, which is designed to keep you cool in warm weather. This shirt is considered a LOOSE fit, which means you will most likely want to purchase a smaller size for a more comfortable fit. The shirt has a flattering V-neck cut and has a twisted, or heathered, pattern that makes it different than a solid color shirt. These shirts are made in Jordan of 100% polyester. Washing instructions say to wash with similar colors. I always put these in the washing machine on a normal cycle, hang them up to dry, and I've never had a problem with shrinking.\n",

For size reference, I am 5'6\", 165 pounds, with a 36D chest and some extra belly fat from my twin pregnancy and I purchased a medium. I typically wear a medium or large in shirts and, since this shirt is a loose fit, I went with the medium and it fits perfectly! These shirts are so comfortable and I wear them a lot for working out. They keep me as cool and dry as possible (of course, I still sweat). They wash up well and I am also able to wear them for everyday wear with yoga pants. My mom is in her early 60s and wears these shirts for everyday wear, along with under her scrubs for work. She loves them as much as I do and wants to get some more! The fit is nice and comes down to the top of my rear, which is just how I like.

Perhaps more cotton content or maybe microfiber like my favorite tights. 2) For my build, the calves and ankles were too big but not tremendously so. Again, with more rebound in the fabric that part could have been cut smaller and really fit to the leg. All things considered, and for how hard it is to find decent clothes this size, kudos Amazon and I recommend. I do not recommend wearing them in summer, they get pretty slimy. :)\n",

Length of torso is OK, but I would have liked about a couple of inches longer. If I had to buy again, I probably would pick large (which would cause the sleeves to be too long for me). Speaking of sleeves, after washing it the first time, the lower portion of the sleeves felt too tight.

If you're bigger than I am - the torso of the shirt will fit but if you have \"bulky\" arms - forget it. I also ordered the same shirt in BLACK Large - I've found it's just easier to order two sizes online and keep one (pain but that's our world today). The black looked great but the arms would fit a kid - way too tight. It's almost as if they sewed the same arms on both shirts. Something is way off. I must say - it was 100% cotton.

We order the shirt tops one size larger, ordering 7 LARGE top shirts with long sleeves all made in Haiti. These shirts arrived in three separate packages. Opened them up, tried them on. Wife got her torso into the shirt, fit nicely around her shoulders and breasts. The ARM’s were MUCH TOO THIN & NARROW, she wasn’t able to get her arms fully into the tops. We were fearful of the seem coming apart had she forced her arms further into the top. We were and still are QUITE DISAPPOINTED as these tops had nice smooth feel and would be immensely comfortable had these LARGE tops fit fully with her medium frame. We returned ALL within a week, obtaining a full refund for each of the 7 tops. We are still looking for shirts of this type, AMERICAN MADE not foreign made. We loved the colors, loved cloth weight, but the arms for these LARGE top’s were like that of an EXTRA SMALL top - much too tight.\n",

      "Review: I ordered 2 of these T-shirts, one in the Sizzling Pink color and the other in a blue that is called Deep Dive. In both cases, the colors were MUCH different than they appeared on my computer screen. The pink looked like a muted rose color on my computer, but ended up more like its name -- a really bright, hot pink. The Deep Dive blue ended up being a vivid dark turquoise. I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large because other reviews said that these 100% cotton shirts would shrink quite a bit, and I don't like shirts that are too tight around my hips. When I first tried these t-shirts on, both were too large, and the sleeves were too long, so I washed them both in hot water and dried them in the dryer on high heat (instructions said to use cold water and low dryer heat). The turquoise shirt shrank to the perfect size including sleeve length. However, the bright pink shirt was still 2 or 3 inches too long in the sleeve, and I noticed that the neck was cut differently than on the turquoise shirt -- the turquoise one had a crew neck, and the pink one was lower, more of a scoop neck. Strange, because these two shirts were supposed to be identical except for color. I am keeping the turquoise shirt and returning the bright pink one.\n",

      "Review: I was traveling from a cold climate to a warm one and didn’t want to bring a jacket. I bought this shirt to wear under a blouse to and from the airport. It was perfect. I have since used it under a sweater on very cold days and it makes such a difference. Because of the other reviews I purposely bought one 2 sizes too big and pre washed it in warm water (instructions say to use cold). The first wash it shrunk one full size, the second just a bit more. It now fits perfectly. No tightness anywhere and the sleeves come to my wrist. The body length shrunk most but I still have a good 3-4 inches I can tuck into a skirt or pants. It is very thin and lightweight so it doesn’t feel bulky at all but still adds warmth. It is much too thin to wear alone but is so soft which is very important for my extremely sensitive skin. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. Since it’s basically a very comfortable long sleeve undershirt I think $6-8 a piece would be reasonable. At that price I would buy several more! I had bought some thicker pre-washed cotton long sleeve Ts at a local arts and crafts store for $5 each. They do the same job but this one is so much more comfortable.\n",

      "Review: I recently got a pair of FULLSOFT Sweatpants for Women, and let me tell you, they have quickly become my go-to lounge pants. These joggers are the ultimate combination of comfort, style, and functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the comfort factor is off the charts. The material is soft, cozy, and feels fantastic against the skin. It's the kind of fabric you want to live in, whether you're lounging around the house, running errands, or even heading to the gym. They strike the perfect balance between lightweight and warm, making them suitable for year-round wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit is just right. They're not too tight or too baggy, and the elastic waistband with a drawstring allows for a customized fit. I also appreciate that they don't bunch up at the ankles, giving them a sleek and stylish appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout features is the pockets. Yes, they have pockets! As someone who always needs a place to stash my phone or keys, this is a game-changer. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold your essentials without feeling bulky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durability is also a key factor for me, and these sweatpants have held up beautifully through multiple washes. The stitching and seams are well-made, and they maintain their shape and color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Styling these joggers is a breeze. They're versatile enough to pair with a cozy sweater for a relaxed day in or dress up with a stylish top and sneakers for a casual outing. The color options are great, too, allowing you to express your personal style.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, FULLSOFT Sweatpants for Women are a fantastic addition to any wardrobe. They tick all the boxes: comfort, style, functionality, and durability. Whether you're relaxing at home, staying active, or running errands, these joggers are an excellent choice. I'm thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend them to anyone in need of comfy and stylish lounge pants.\n",

      "Review: I like this sports bra for the most part. The pros: It is super cute in the front and back where the straps crisscross. The pads or inserts are great because they stay where I want them and don’t slide around when wearing. When washing they stay inside the bra and hold their shape. They don’t come out in the washer (delicate cycle only and hang to dry) with those weird creases and wrinkles in them like some of my other sports bras. The cons: this bra has the crisscross straps in the front cleavage area. While this is a super cute design and looks great on the model, unless you are large busted the straps sort of sag. I ordered a Large, and am usually a 34-36 B, almost a C. While I don’t see myself as well endowed up top, I am certainly not flat chested. With that being said, the straps do sag in the middle cleavage area and stick out of the tops of my dry fit tanks that I wear to the gym. It is a bit annoying. So if you are big busted you probably won’t have any issues. If you are not, just keep in mind those cute little decorative crisscrossed straps at the cleavage will not be completely taut. Otherwise this is a fairly comfortable bra with decent support.\n",

I pair them with loose, cute, comfy tops, and tops that were with other loungewear bottoms. And I can mix and match these. I bought black and blue; mixing and matching allows me more outfits to wear.

      "Review: 5’2” and 160 lbs. and bought 4 pair of these for $6 per pair. I needed some to lounge around at home, and even after reading the negative reviews, figured it was worth giving them a try as the price was right. Because of my height, I always pre-wash and machine dry washable pants at least 3 times before shortening them. Also, I am losing weight so don’t want to spend a lot of money on clothes right now and look for things I can wear while my weight goes up and down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, after washing and drying each pair 3 times, they each shrunk about 3 inches. That is actually pretty normal for sweats. They were about 4 1/2 inches too long, so that is all right for me. Also, they were washed in warm water with no liquid fabric softener, and dried on a normal cotton cycle using dryer sheets. The fabric and colors came out great with little piling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the fit, they actually fit just like the ones in the add. They are quite slim at the hips and wide in the legs. They also are short geared (length from the waist to the crotch area), so could be uncomfortable for someone medium height or taller. The waist elastic is fairly loose yet the hips fit snug. I have a more hour-glass shape so may fit better on someone with smaller hips or flatter butt. The worst part is how wide the legs are, with no tapering at all. It can be very unflattering. I am a seamstress, so can easily shorten the pants. As for the wide legs, there is no side Sean that could easily be taken in. The cheap price makes it worthwhile for me to spend the time changing them. I will probably unstitch the sides of the waistband, make side seams that taper a little, also taper the inner leg seams, tighten the waistband elastic, and should end up with nice looking, warm, and comfortable sweats that should last me through the rest of my weight loss process without spending a lot of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, if you are a slimmer built person who like the wider legs style or would just add elastic to the bottom of the legs, and can get these sweats at a great price, I do recommend them. The colors are great and the fabric is soft and comfy, warm but not too warm.\n",

      "Review update - I have finally worn a pair of these sweatpants. I’m 5’ 2” tall, 160 lbs., and hourglass shape. These sweatpants fit a little snug when first on, but after awhile fit just right around the waist and hips for me (a petite in pants). The rise (length from the natural waistline to the crotch area) is perfect, almost a little short. Also, after being washed and dried 3 times, the length is still 2 1/2” too long. That means these pants should fit a short person fine after hemming them, and an average person perfect in length and if they like a lower waistline.\n",

I am usually always a medium in a top and I found this medium to be too tight across the chest area. It fit fine through the shoulders and sleeves, just too tight through the upper torso. For reference, I am a 36D up top and a size 8 for slacks. So I'm not overly thick. I've been looking for long sleeved tops to wear to play tennis as well, and I think this material will work.

I just ordered what seemed like a new color, very light gray/silver, but as it turns out, the photo is a bit misleading. I just received it and it is the same color as another I purchased about 2 years ago, just a different name and photo. The silverly looking color is actually darker than pictured, similar to the black heather color. Although my other shirt is still in excellent condition, like new, I will keep this one. I was hoping for a lighter color to wear in the summer but this is not it. Aside from that, these fit fairly loose but I order a size up, a medium, so I can move around comfortably in it. I find the cool-dri works well in the summer heat when I am doing many farm chores outside. The long sleeves keep my arms clean, dry and protected from the sun. I wear the heck out of these in the summer and they have never come apart or shown signs of wear. I am truly impressed, especially for the price. In the winter, I use them for my workouts and never feel overheated or sweaty at the end so they do breath. I am 5'4\", 122 lbs. and prefer the medium, although a small would probably fit well, just a bit more snug than I prefer.\n",

      "Review: I wondered why it was so cheap. It cost the company almost $5 to mail it. It came the next day via USPS. It runs very small. I usually wear a medium to large so I ordered a large since I wanted it for exercise. It is very form fitting. I can use it for an undershirt to keep warm this winter. And the neckline was not even. I think it was a “second.” Anyway as I said, my large size has become a body fitting undershirt. If you want one, order about 2sizes larger than you usually wear.\n",

      "Review: The description says \"feminine\" but we found it to be bulky, boxy and not flattering to an hourglass figure. Size small was far too large on a 5'4\" 110lb frame. The primary photo in the listing is pretty accurate. The others which make it seem like it might be tailored a bit on the sides, are not as true to reality. This is just one experience. If you're buying to work out in and don't need that feminine look, this is probably a good product. We returned so didn't have a chance to wash/dry to see how it turns out. If this review was helpful, please mark it as such and this will motivate us to leave thorough reviews =)\n",

I purchased one of the V-neck and one of the crew-neck shirts. Both are snug in the bust, as compared to other brands. Just a heads up for anyone purchasing, who might be large busted...[I am average and notice the snugger fit]. Otherwise the shirts are plenty roomy in the tummy and long enough in the arms.

I typically opt for the racerback tank top style for my workout shirts but I'm also very fair-skinned and I wanted a bit more protection from the sun for my shoulders and back when I'm outside during peak sunshine hours. I own a number of Under Armour products so I was well aware of the quality when I decided to purchase this shirt. Like a lot of people, I was hesitant on the sizing since Under Armour's clothes fit differently depending on the style. Under Armour classifies this shirt as a loose fit as opposed to semi-fitted, fitted, or compression fit.\n",

      "For reference, I am 5'6\", 150 pounds, with a 36D chest and a medium fits me perfectly! I wear a medium or large depending on the style and fit of the shirt but, thanks to the help of other reviewers, I was able to successfully order my correct size for this shirt. This shirt is part of UA's Heatgear line which is meant to keep you cool when it's warm out. I've already worn this shirt several times and it is incredibly comfortable. It is made in Jordan of 100% polyester and is very soft and lightweight. It is so comfortable that I don't have any problems with range of motion or anything while exercising. This shirt is a V-neck style which is nice since it adds a little bit of a design over the scoop neck style shirts and it still has good chest coverage so I don't feel like I'm indecent while bending over. It has an UA logo on the left side of the chest as well as one on the back of the shirt, just below the neck. The length is also really nice and comfortably rests on my upper thighs. I've worn this shirt while walking and playing basketball and have still managed to stay fairly cool. Even though this shirt is lightweight, I don't feel that it's sheer and would show anything that's not meant to be seen. The shirt also washes up nicely. I typically hang dry these shirts so they don't get caught on anything in the dryer and so far, they've been great!\n",

      "I'm so happy I found this shirt because it's become my go-to t-shirt for working out when I don't want to wear my racerbacks. I originally ordered the Montana Teal/Metallic Silver color and loved it so much that I also ordered Flint/Metallic Silver and Coho/Metallic Silver. I've included a picture of my three shirts so you can see what they look like. At first I thought the Flint/Metallic Silver was a gray color but when I got it, it's actually more of a dusky lilac and, since I love purple, I am even happier! I think the hardest thing for most people is to figure out what size to order for this shirt. My thoughts are, if you have two sizes of shirts that you normally order depending on the brand and style, order the smaller size for this shirt. That's what I did and these shirts ended up fitting me perfectly. They are even nice enough to wear out in public so they are definitely versatile. I highly recommend these shirts because they are great for exercising, there are a lot of colors to choose from, and the price is perfect so you can order more than one!\n",

      "Review: These are great shirts to feed horses in, as the hay doesn't stick to the shirts. They are great shirts to layer with, they wick moisture away from you, and they are comfortable. However, if you sweat in them, it will be difficult to tell who is stinkier, you or your sweaty horse. They also do not dry out quickly if you hang them up. If you hang them up on the radiator, they will dry and they will still stink, ergo only 4 stars. If you feed horses three times a day in the Winter, you need three of these shirts or your body will basically be a party bus for sweat swilling bacteria. An Ariat Lowell shirt is basically the same material, but the material does not trap odor like the Under Armour, and you can hang up and air out and wear the Ariat more than once. Would be nice if UA could fix this issue, as washing all those shirts isn't exactly environmentally friendly, even if it means they sell more shirts. If the UA shirt was not on sale, I honestly would not have bought so many of them.\n",

I have a lot of fleece sweatshirts and wear only a couple of them because my skin is very sensitive and I can't wear any scratchy material against my skin. After numerous washings, the once soft lining of my heavy fleece sweatshirts gets stiff and scratchy, and for me, very uncomfortable. So basically out of about 4 dozen fleece sweatshirts, I only wear a few of the newest ones that are still kind of soft. I've found that I can wear one of these lightweight sweatshirts under my heavy fleece ones, and I'm comfortable because these sweatshirts are just so soft. With using these as liners, I can now go back to using my entire collection of sweatshirts comfortably.\n",

I take them everywhere and live in them all summer with cold indoor air conditioned offices & buildings. I’m a 2x in most plus sized brands. The2x JMS hoodie fits more like a 1x on me. What I’ve found out by buying these again & again and not truly paying attention to the actual label brand, is that the Hanes Her Way slub hoodies (which are exactly the same hoodie in regular women’s sizing) in XXL fit much more comfortably than the JMS 2x. I can zip the HHW xxl and still have a comfortable fit & feel, but if I zip the JMS 2X, I look & feel like a stuffed sausage lol.\n",

      "Review: Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted. I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lot\n",

As a B-C cup (depending on the bra) and and XL tshirt size, these are amazing and I've now ordered another color in the XL size of the tank. I feel like they're fitted enough to smooth and give me plenty of lift and support which I was skeptical of since I'm not a \"perky\" lady if ya catch my drift. I also love the thickness of the straps and the feel of the material. I wear them as shirts in various settings and feel plenty comfortable to do so but would not wear them to a \"jumpy/bouncy\" workout class- they're not THAT supportive. I will also say that they're not modest and do end up showing a decent amount of cleavage so if that's not your jam, you may end up returning.\n",

I love the bootcut/open bottom as I don’t like yoga pants that are essentially leggings - if I wanted leggings, I’d get leggings. My biggest complaint is the waistband. It’s a bit stiff and while I get that it’s supposed to help with not rolling, it’s also a tad narrow - these are not high waisted pants. Given the stiffness and shorter waistband, I don’t see myself wearing these for yoga. Comfortable and stretchy, sure, but I can’t do malasana without risking a big gap in the back - I don’t want to have to worry about making sure my shirt is long enough or that I’m not trying out for a plumber’s calendar when working on my poses.

      "\n",
      "Ordered the XL because at my age, I'm done with constricting clothing. Since I'm short, they come closer to my natural waist than the ones on the model, and the hem falls a wee bit lower. [Hint: if, after being washed a few times, the leggings start to come apart at the inseam, ask yourself if it's just that they've been WORN a few times - presumably that's why they were washed - and that maybe you should try a bigger size.] These are totally opaque on me - another reason I ordered the XL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presumably some marketing person came up with \"wide waistband\" as a way of explaining their construction. In actuality, they have a double thickness yoke at the top - as a close look at the image will show. Between the layers of fabric, a piece of elastic perhaps 5/8\" wide is stitched into place. This, along with the lack of a side seam, the gusset, and the substantial, stretchy fabric must be why these leggings fit so many different women so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, the cotton-rich fabric feels great, though I will be sticking to black. I would love to have a true charcoal or gray, but of course these days what they usually mean is a lighter or darker heather, which for some reason has a higher polyester content. (At least it does in the Charcoal Jockeys, otherwise I wouldn't always find myself reaching for them last.) The \"wicking liner\" doesn't hurt, but - being not much bigger than the triangle you see on a suit pocket handkerchief - doesn't add much either\n",

      "Because I undergo frequent \"climate\" changes (both the internal and external kind), these are my daily at-home uniform for about half the year. On a mild winter day, they're enough protection for a quick trip to the mailbox, especially if I pull on a pair of boots/booties. If it's cold, I can quickly throw a pair of regular pants over them. Yet, they're not unbearable in an overheated room.\n",

Jockey is a great brand, but I guess you should expect everything of theirs to be intimates. I do like them but haven't made the effort to wear them regularly out of concern for damaging the fabric and construction. The knees of the pants stretch out with wear and have tightened up with the first few washes so far, but who knows when they'll permanently stretch. These are definitely loungewear or to be worn with your butt covered. They're not terribly sheer but you shouldn't take the chance. I also have average sized but muscular calves and the opening is tight enough to be annoying. If I decide to buy this again I do want to try size medium.

I've tried lots of leggings and these are great. The only weird thing I have noticed is that the fabric is getting a bit fuzzy around the knees from kneeling so much. The seams are holding up so far. Wish they made some organic cotton ones!\n",

      "Review: I do medium/high impact workouts. And good workout bras are EXPENSIVE! One day all my good workout bras were dirty, so I doubled up on these bras. And guess what, with 2 of these bras at the same time (1 camisole bralette & 1 sports bralette) - I was just as supported as my good workout bra - for a whole $8!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what I have learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "TYPES - There are now MANY types of bras under this one heading. I have both the CAMISOLE type and the SPORTS BRALETTE type (both have spaghetti straps are not adjustable). I would NOT call them sports bras, but rather \"bralettes\" or shelf bras. They feel like cotton and have non-adjustable straps (but the non-adjustability does not seem to be an issue for most people). I bought both in the white, black, grey sets. The sports bralette type has ruching, that doesn't look all that great and doesn't really add to the bra. But the straps of the sports bralette are really cute. The sports bralette comes with ONE set of padded inserts that can be moved from one sports bralette to the other. Because I always wear a shirt when working out, these inserts are unnecessary, so I am not using them. The set of inserts comes with the sports bralette, but NOT with the camisole type. To confirm you are buying the correct type, make sure you click on the color options and look at the accompanying photos, because the DESCRIPTION DOES NOT CHANGE!\n",
      "\n",
      "SIZING - I am a 34D(or DD) or a 36C/D. And with these bralettes I wear a 38. It feels snug and appropriately supported. For the bralettes I bought, the camisole type actually fits a bit more snug and the sports bralette type fits a bit looser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my sizing and what I have read from the other reviews, here is how I would guess the sizing works:\n",
      "A cup - go actual size.\n",
      "B cup - Sports Bralette go actual size, Camisole go up 1 size.\n",
      "C cup - go up 1 size.\n",
      "D cup - go up 1 size for Sports Bralette and 2 sizes for Camisole.\n",
      "DD and bigger - go up 2 sizes. But if you are well endowed with a small rib cage (e.g., 32 DD or bigger) then this bra may not work for you, because if you go up more than 2 sizes, the band at the bottom may be too big. (But again, for me with a 34D(or DD) or a 36C/D - a 38 is perfect.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whew - get all that? :) Again, this is all only a guess - but hopefully my guessing helps a little. Basically the bigger your cup size, the more sizes up you need to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "(UPDATE: It is now May 2020, we are 2 months into the COVID 19 Pandemic and are \"sheltering in place\". Consequently it is now 2 months since I have worn an underwire bra! Even though my size 38s are still great and still work after 3 years of use, they are now a bit tighter, so I use them when I want more support/working out. But I wanted something a little less tight for \"sheltering in place\", so I bought a size 40 of the \"sports bralette\" with the ruching. I am essentially living in them - both for sleep and working around the house all day. But the reason for writing this update (beside the fact that these are truly good enough to live in) is that the sports bralettes I just purchased no longer have the separate pad to insert into the bralette for 'modesty'. So if you order the sports bralette it is unlikely that you will receive a removable pad.)\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW I WEAR THEM - I use the camisole type when I have a low cut shirt and too much cleavage is a bit inappropriate. Sometimes I wear it alone, or sometimes I wear my bra under it. I also use it alone for low impact sports (I just wore is skiing and it was perfect.) Or for my high impact workouts I use the sports bralette type and the camisole type together - in the same color, and all the straps look pretty cute! Also, because the straps are all in different places, it doesn't hurt my neck/top of my shoulders like some of my \"real\" sports bra do - the pressure/weight is spread out if you use the 2 different bra types together. (I have included 3 pictures of my back: a) camisole; b) sports bralette and c) both together.)\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHING: make sure to hang dry these bras - but other than that I have had no issue with either the quality or the washing of these bras. The directions say to hand wash and hang dry, but machine washing and hang drying seem to be fine. (On the other hand, if they are too big when you buy them, stick them in the dryer, because they will shrink a bit!)\n",
      "\n",
      "IN SUM - at $4-5 a bra it is an amazing price point. And for $8-10 to double them up and use them for workouts is awesome! And they are much cuter than my ugly old workout bras. I hope this is helpful to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "2018 UPDATE: I have now been using the same bralettes (2 packs of 3) for more than a year. They have gotten a hint smaller over time (even though I always hang them dry). But they still fit, they still have great elastic, they are still soft and they still look just as good as the day I bought them. These have been a GREAT purchase!\n",

Now that I have lost some weight AND have a quality sports bra, I have started wearing it all of the time for outdoor tennis. It is inexpensive; that is a plus. However, the tags in mine crunched up into a sharp-edged wad on the first washing (I followed the directions to the letter!). This tag wad either stuck up or cut into the top of my back; I finally cut the tags out. Just not worth the scratching. Also, the stitching on the garment was second-quality at best. I realize I am buying something inexpensive but does it have to come with obvious quality problems? Will give it another try but also buying other brands.\n",

I wanted another pair and chose blue. In the past with other Amazon brand clothing items I've noticed inconsistency in the products. I have shirts I ordered from the same listing same time and they are all different sizes and fits. I was really hoping these pants would be the same as the black and quality hadn't changed. Unfortunately they changed. The blue pair I received has much thinner material. It's less stretchy. I compared waistband sizes and the blue are about 2 inches smaller than the black. The elastic in the blue feels awful. It feels cheap and it doesn't stretch at all. They had a good thing going with these and like all things Amazon they had to change it up for worse quality items.
